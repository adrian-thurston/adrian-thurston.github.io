<PRE>sorry about the vague description..

basically i am working with click modular routers.i am trying to
separate the data plane and the control plane..

i will try to represent the control plane with a state machine..the
the packets[like those of sk_buffer]will have to be to parsed and and
the the control action[like binding update and router solicitation
etc]should be converted to tokens and fed into the state machine...in
the state machine depening upon the state an action should take place
with state transition..

what i am worried about is that will it be possible for me to use the
parser associated with  that of ragel to parse the incoming packet[bit
patterns] at real time?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ragel generates a state machine, which it uses to extract tokens from
</I>&gt;<i> input. In principle, the state machine takes as input a stream of
</I>&gt;<i> characters, though in practice those 'characters' can be anything you
</I>&gt;<i> can represent using integers (the precise type can be specified to get
</I>&gt;<i> more bits per character).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It isn't clear from your description whether the state machine you are
</I>&gt;<i> talking about would be the one Ragel generates for you, or some other
</I>&gt;<i> one, but either case is fine. You basically supply your own 'template'
</I>&gt;<i> code for the Ragel state machine, so you can get your input character
</I>&gt;<i> stream any way you want and use your output tokens in any way you
</I>&gt;<i> want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could even use the output from one Ragel machine as the input for
</I>&gt;<i> another one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only doubt I have is your mention of 'bit patterns'. As you can
</I>&gt;<i> handle input any way you want, there is in principle no difficulty,
</I>&gt;<i> but to the best of my knowledge you cannot use the current state to
</I>&gt;<i> determine how to decode the next input. You could not take variable-
</I>&gt;<i> bit-width characters from the input, for instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You certainly can handle something like UTF-8 decoding, though - you
</I>&gt;<i> just have a machine that takes 8-bit 'characters' as input and outputs
</I>&gt;<i> unicode codepoints as its result (possibly sending them to another
</I>&gt;<i> Ragel machine that tokenises the unicode character sequence).
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, there's no reason why you can't convert UTF-8 to unicode
</I>&gt;<i> codepoints in a single Ragel machine, but it's probably easier to
</I>&gt;<i> cascade two machines to do the job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equally, you could process a Huffman-encoded input if you really want
</I>&gt;<i> to. You couldn't handle the input in multi-bit chunks, but you could
</I>&gt;<i> handle it one bit at a time. The only condition is that the particular
</I>&gt;<i> encoding would have to be fixed. This would work because Huffman
</I>&gt;<i> encoding is a variable-width encoding, designed in such a way that you
</I>&gt;<i> can find the end of each character using a finite state machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Ragel manual is very good, by the way. Just read the section on
</I>&gt;<i> the 'interface to the host program' and I think all your questions
</I>&gt;<i> will be answered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, just on the off chance, I'll also recommend that you take a
</I>&gt;<i> look at the SMC project...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://smc.sourceforge.net/">http://smc.sourceforge.net/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've not actually used it myself, whereas I use Ragel a lot, but
</I>&gt;<i> depending on your state machine requirements it could be more
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ragel has a far more powerful model for specifying finite state
</I>&gt;<i> machines in that it supports regular grammar handling features (like
</I>&gt;<i> regular expressions, but better) as well as explicit specification of
</I>&gt;<i> transitions, and the two forms can be mixed as needed. It also allows
</I>&gt;<i> backtracking scanners (like flex - the scanner generator, not the
</I>&gt;<i> Adobe web framework thing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where SMC appears to win out is if you already have a pure state-
</I>&gt;<i> transition model (e.g. based on a UML state diagram) and you want to
</I>&gt;<i> ha
</I>ndle events that are like class methods, with parameters.
