<PRE>Hi Steve,

You can make such a machine like this:

later = start: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; -&gt; final;

Though using this machine will be difficult. It will create unreachable
states that Ragel removes during compilation. You could give the final
state a label and then reference the label in an action to make sure
that the path from final state onward sticks around, but that's somewhat
hackish.

I would suggest instead giving it a transition, preferably some
character out of the range of allowable input characters.

alphtype int;
later = 0x100;
main := 'm' later '\n';

-Adrian
