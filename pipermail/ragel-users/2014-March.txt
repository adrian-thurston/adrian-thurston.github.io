There is now a mirror of ragel on github.

Message-ID: <CALdfqQL+hzwsTkSr=D-dXn+hpNJ-e9A02uzAwvsDjkK4xVU6rA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I wanted to let you all know that I am maintaining a fork of Ragel 6.8 for
the language Rust, which can be found here:

https://github.com/erickt/ragel/tree/rust

I would eventually like to merge this upstream, but since Rust is still
going through massive changes, I'm not sure if it'd make sense to land this
in Ragel at the moment. I'm aiming to submit a proper pull request when
Rust reaches 1.0 later on this year.

Also, are there any plans for cutting a new version of Ragel any time soon?
I'd like for to migrate over to a more recent version of Ragel, but I'm not
sure if it's stable at the moment.

Thanks!
-Erick

Hi Erick,

I noticed the rust backend. I was hoping to merge that sometime.

There will be more releases in the ragel 6 branch. It can be merged there.

Ragel 7 (in master) takes a completely new approach to code generation. 
Your patch will need to be redone in that branch. So far I have C, D, Go 
and C# generators that you can use as a starting point.

Subject: [ragel-users] Debugging colm for win32.
Message-ID: <1396292958.3980.YahooMailNeo@web162002.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Ragel in the git repo is built with an embedded colm processor.  So the first step towards building ragel on Windows is to build colm.  For win64, 
fairly extensive changes would be needed since colm assumes pointers = 
long data type, but in windows pointers = long long. 

However, I 
can easily build colm for win32 with msys/mingw just by commenting out a
 couple of  unneeded headers.  All the tests pass, except for:  
    binary1, exit4 thru exit 6 ( they crash with access violations)
    multiregion2 (it fails parsing the 2nd line, which is blank. I expect it's just a CRLF issue with the script.)

I
 can then compile ragel with no changes, but it fails every test. It 
always reports a parse error in the ".ri" file at the first "}$" line.

There

 is no user guide for colm, so it's difficult for me to debug.   I know 
Adrian Thurston is not building for windows.  but I was hoping that 
someone with intimate knowledge of the software could point me to a 
place to start.

FYI, this is different version than any Ragel released so far. There's a 
ragel-6 (IIRC) branch in the repo which corresponds to the version which is 
released.

Last time I tried the rewritten ragel, it choked on many constructs. I 
reported that on this ML, but didn't get any feedback, so I presume this is 
still an unfinished work.

Cheers,
Jan
