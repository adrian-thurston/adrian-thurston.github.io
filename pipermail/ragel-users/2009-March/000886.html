<PRE>Since Ragel makes it so easy to generate code in several languages,  
I'm adding a pure-ruby parser to RedCloth (it already has C and Java  
extensions).  My only problem is that the actions of the last pattern  
matched by the scanner don't happen.  It is happening in both my  
block-level scanner and my inline scanner and it's different patters/ 
actions that fail to execute, but always at the end of the string.  I  
traced it through using ruby-debug but couldn't tell anything because  
it was deep in the scanner (i.e. all the code I recognized as actions  
worked as intended, but I couldn't tell what was going on with  
scanner internals).  I'm sure it's just something I'm doing wrong,  
but just wanted to check if anyone had any ideas before I spend hours  
trying to figure it out.

If you want to try it hand-on, git clone the pureruby branch of <A HREF="git://">git://</A> 
github.com/jgarber/redcloth.git and try rake pureruby test.  You can  
also peek at it at <A HREF="http://github.com/jgarber/redcloth/tree/pureruby">http://github.com/jgarber/redcloth/tree/pureruby</A>  
to see if you notice anything obvious.

Thanks in advance for any insight you might be able to provide.

Jason Garber
