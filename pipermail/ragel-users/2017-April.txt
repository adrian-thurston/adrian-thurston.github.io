Hey guys, I remember there was a time (something like 3 or 4 years ago?)
that ragel Windows binary was also distributed on its main page but now it
is not. Can you please put the compiled Windows binary of ragel on the main
page again? That would be very helpful for novice people trying to use
ragel on Windows and for its use for CI scripts targeting Windows. Thanks

Hi Ebrahim, 

I'm not aware of anyone producing windows binaries right now. I don't do
any development on windows myself so I don't build them.

Hai

This is something that I want to look into, once I got colm on msvc.
The downside is that I'm quite busy, so it might take a while for me
pick it (colm) up.

I don't use Windows machines much also nowadays but I have a simple
solution that one without a Windows can also build ragel windows binary:

1. Login into https://gist.github.com/ (is GitHub pastebin service which
also provides Git repos at the same time) and type something and create an
empty gist.

2. Login into https://ci.appveyor.com (is a Windows CI service) with your
Github account, or any other way you like

3. https://ci.appveyor.com/projects/new create a new Git project with the
empty gist link you just created on step 1.

4. Go to SETTING tab and on environment tab add this: RAGEL_VERSION with
this value 6.10 then press Save

5. On Build, choose SCRIPT, then CMD and then enter this command

C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash -lc 'cd $APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER; wget
http://www.colm.net/files/ragel/ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION.tar.gz; tar -xf
ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION.tar.gz; cd ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION;
PATH=$PATH:/mingw32/bin; ./configure --prefix=/mingw32/
--build=i686-w64-mingw32 --host=i686-w64-mingw32; make LDFLAGS="--static"'

Press Save.

6. On the Artifacts, add this artifact path,

ragel-*/ragel/ragel.exe

Press Save.

7. Go to the LATEST BUILD tab, press NEW BUILD

8. Wait for the completion of the build, after that, the self contained
compiled exe output will be put on ARTIFICATS tab, download it.

(This is just the simple working walkthrough, you can custom it as you
wish, let me know if you failed on doing any of these steps)

With this instruction, can I request putting this exe somewhere on the
official site? Thanks

Awesome, thank you for the info! And yes I can certainly post a binary.

1. Login into https://gist.github.com/ (is GitHub pastebin service which
also provides Git repos at the same time) and type something and create an
empty gist.

2. Login into https://ci.appveyor.com (is a Windows CI service) with your
Github account, or any other way you like

3. https://ci.appveyor.com/projects/new create a new Git project with the
empty gist link you just created on step 1.

4. Go to SETTING tab and on environment tab add this: RAGEL_VERSION with
this value 6.10 then press Save

5. On Build, choose SCRIPT, then CMD and then enter this command

C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash -lc 'cd $APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER; wget
http://www.colm.net/files/ragel/ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION.tar.gz; tar -xf
ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION.tar.gz; cd ragel-$RAGEL_VERSION;
PATH=$PATH:/mingw32/bin; ./configure --prefix=/mingw32/
--build=i686-w64-mingw32 --host=i686-w64-mingw32; make LDFLAGS="--static"'

Press Save.

6. On the Artifacts, add this artifact path,

ragel-*/ragel/ragel.exe

Press Save.

7. Go to the LATEST BUILD tab, press NEW BUILD

8. Wait for the completion of the build, after that, the self contained
compiled exe output will be put on ARTIFICATS tab, download it.

(This is just the simple working walkthrough, you can custom it as you
wish, let me know if you failed on doing any of these steps)

With this instruction, can I request putting this exe somewhere on the
official site? Thanks

Awesome, thank you for the info! And yes I can certainly post a binary.
