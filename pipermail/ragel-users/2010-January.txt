Subject: [ragel-users] arithmetic overflow in generated C# code
Message-ID: <187d99921001270146g45fafc15j55560bcaad4aebbe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We've run into a possible bug in the c# code generation - for a set of input
files (http://gist.github.com/287694), the generated _lexer_actions table
have a length of 130, while the generated type of the indexers (_acts and
__acts) is sbyte ([-128..127]), causing an overflow (and an index out of
range exception afterwards) when executing the actions. Using Java as
output, or changing the types of these variables to short in C# result
in the generated machine working as expected. Based on the sources, for all
output languages except C#, these indexers have a hardcoded type of UINT.

Can someone please confirm whether it's really a bug, and/or if there's any
workaround?

thx,
sztupi

I'm trying to reproduce by compiling with mono-gmcs, but I don't seem to 
have ILexer and the compilation stops there. Is that a system library or 
something from Gherkin?

oh, I didn't include all the sources needed to compile the result c#, just
what's enough to see the problem. The included sources are part of our fork
of gherkin at http://github.com/techtalk/gherkin/tree/dotnet-port. I haven't
tried to compile it with mono yet, so I can't guarantee that you can get it
running.

Anyway, thanks for trying,
sztupi
