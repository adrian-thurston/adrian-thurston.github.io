Indeed, still a work in progress. I am rewriting the code generators in the new style. About halfway done. After that I will probably work on stability.

FYI, this is different version than any Ragel released so far. There's a 
ragel-6 (IIRC) branch in the repo which corresponds to the version which is 
released.

Last time I tried the rewritten ragel, it choked on many constructs. I 
reported that on this ML, but didn't get any feedback, so I presume this is 
still an unfinished work.

Cheers,
Jan

I've not looked at the code in question, so don't know if this helps.

Pointers should not be long nor long long they should be size_t .

See <stddef.h> and <stdint.h>.

When we move to 128 bit parts we'd have to go down this road again,
that is what size_t is meant to prevent.  It is the difference between
memory space and arithmetic bit widths.

This isn't true in C. In C the only well-defined way to convert a pointer to
an integer and back again is via intptr_t or uintptr_t.

Does C++ really require the same behavior for size_t?

cstdint.hpp from Boost, which is what I have at hand says:

// intptr_t/uintptr_t are defined separately because they are optional
and not universally available

size_t and relatives should always be available unless using compilers
that are not compliant to standards and don't come with stdint.h .

Alas pointers are mine fields due to the varying widths, such as this
from the C99 Standard:

              /*
               * You may not even convert a void * to a function
               * pointer by explicit casting (6.3.2.3|1).
               *
               * C's abstract machine does not assume that code and
               * data are addressed the same way, so as far as C is
               * concerned function pointers and data pointers have
               * nothing to do with each other (they could have
               * different widths).
               */
Which can lead to the sickening mess of pointer decoration that has no
standard between compilers.

The bottom line is it is always wrong to use (long) long as a pointer
type.  What to use in its place depends on the tools being used.

intptr_t and uintptr_t are optional because the ability to do a round-trip
conversion from a pointer through an integer is not something all
environments support or that the standard requires. The C standard only
provides intptr_t as a common type _if_ the environment supports the
operation.

If <stdint.h> is available, then I'd be surprised if intptr_t wasn't
defined, presuming the operation was supported. <stdint.h> was created by
C99, the same standard that defined intptr_t.

size_t is only required to be wide enough to describe the size of any
_single_ valid object in the system, which basically means wide enough for
the sizeof operator to work. Pointers can be wider than size_t. The most
common example was x86 real mode, but everybody discounts that as no longer
applicable.

If you Google around, you'll find that, for example, the C environment for
the AS/400 (and successors) has 128-bit data and function pointers but
size_t is only 32-bit and doubles 64-bit. Therefore, presuming the AS/400
supported integer/pointer conversions (it might not, because that might
allow circumventing memory capability protections), you would have to use
intptr_t or uintptr_t.

Hi,

I'm building a parser for a protocol message similar to HTTP (let's
say: a main header and N key: value separated by CRLF until a final
double CRLF). My concern is:

- I parse the messages in a "Dispatcher" module that just needs to
parse a few fields in each message.
- Then the Dispatcher passes the message to a Worker thread via UNIX Socket.
- And the Worker must parse it again, but in this case I need all the
fields parsed.

Note that during the Worker's parsing, a C++ complex object is build
with all the parsed fields mapped into member variables, so I don't
want to play with those complex objects in the Dispatcher module.

How could I reuse the same Ragel machine for both cases? Of course I
would like something like:



%%{
  machine Parser;

  [...]

  if (dispatcher) {
    main :=  xxxxxxx
  }
  else {
    main := yyyyyyy
  }

}%%



Thanks a lot.

Mmm, I think using the "when" statement is the way to go :)

Hi,

I'm building a parser for a protocol message similar to HTTP (let's
say: a main header and N key: value separated by CRLF until a final
double CRLF). My concern is:

- I parse the messages in a "Dispatcher" module that just needs to
parse a few fields in each message.
- Then the Dispatcher passes the message to a Worker thread via UNIX Socket.
- And the Worker must parse it again, but in this case I need all the
fields parsed.

Note that during the Worker's parsing, a C++ complex object is build
with all the parsed fields mapped into member variables, so I don't
want to play with those complex objects in the Dispatcher module.

How could I reuse the same Ragel machine for both cases? Of course I
would like something like:



%%{
  machine Parser;

  [...]

  if (dispatcher) {
    main :=  xxxxxxx
  }
  else {
    main := yyyyyyy
  }

}%%



Thanks a lot.

Subject: [ragel-users] Parsing a stream in Go
Message-ID: <1397178505.30412.21.camel@hoplite.sd.cox.net>

I've been trying to figure out how to parse a stream in Go without much
luck.  Does anyone have an example they could share, or perhaps some
documentation?
