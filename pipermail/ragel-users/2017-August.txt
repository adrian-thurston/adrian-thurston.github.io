Subject: [ragel] "include" does not check same directory in ragel 7? (trying
 to build rspamd)
Message-ID: <9826b410-f527-f314-0c0d-76a367f862a7@oss.schwarz.eu>

Hey,

I try to get rspamd (https://github.com/vstakhov/rspamd/) to build while using
ragel 7 [1]. As documented in various bug reports this is not possible right
now and I'd like to find out why this is (knowning next to nothing about ragel).

This is the error I'm getting (CentOS 7) with the latest colm/ragel/rspamd git
versions:

[ 43%] [RAGEL][ragel_smtp_addr] Compiling state machine with Ragel 7.0.0.10
error: could not open smtp_address.rl
/bin/sh: line 1:  9721 Segmentation fault      /usr/local/bin/ragel -T1
-o/foo/rspamd/src/smtp_addr_parser.rl.c /foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_addr_parser.rl
make[2]: *** [src/smtp_addr_parser.rl.c] Error 139


"smtp_addr_parser.rl" contains these lines (and some more):
%%{

  machine smtp_date_parser;
  include smtp_date "smtp_date.rl";

  main := date_time;
}%%

"smtp_date.rl" is located in the same directory as "smtp_date.rl". The script
can be compiled with ragel 6 without any problems.

If I add the full patch in the include statement everything works as expected.
Also when I manually "cd" into the directory everything is fine.

The "ragel guide" (PDF) for 6.10 says:
"Ragel searches for included files from the location of the current file.
Additional directories can be added to the search path using the -I option."


I seems that this behavior did change in 0.7 but I'm not sure if that is a bug
or a conscious decision. Also adding "-I /foo/rspamd/src/ragel/" to the call
did not help.

thank you very much
Felix


[1] Background:
Somehow the Fedora maintainer for ragel decided to use development releases of
colm/ragel in Fedora (and even EPEL/CentOS). This unfortunate decision was
maybe facilitated by the odd/even version numbering schema of ragel.

Subject: [ragel] "including" the same file multiple times (ragel 6 vs 7 /
 building rspamd)
Message-ID: <6a8c23a4-f9e7-2947-f315-aee9f6fd61e4@oss.schwarz.eu>


still trying to compile rspamd with ragel 7.x. One important difference seems
to be that rspamd tries to include the same .rl file multiple times.

E.g. smtp_received.rl:
  include smtp_whitespace "smtp_whitespace.rl";
  ...
  include smtp_date "smtp_date.rl";

now "smtp_date.rl" contains:
%%{
  machine smtp_date;

  include smtp_whitespace "smtp_whitespace.rl";

  # SMTP date spec
  # Obtained from: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section_3.3


So there is a "duplicate" declaration of "smtp_whitespace" which leads to
errors in the compilation process:
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:4:3: fsm "WSP" previously defined
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:5:3: fsm "CRLF" previously defined
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:6:3: fsm "DQUOTE" previously defined
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:9:3: fsm "atext" previously defined
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:13:3: fsm "dtext" previously defined
/foo/rspamd/src/ragel/smtp_whitespace.rl:15:3: fsm "ctext" previously defined
...

It seems that ragel 6 just includes the file once. Any idea why this changed
and what should upstream projects do about this?

thank you very much,
Felix

Hi.

GCC7's Wimplicit-fallthrough diagnostics triggers a lot on generated C
code in "-G2" mode. It was intended to catch errors, in hope that
developer would document places where code is intended to fall through
case statement. But currently there are no such comments in a generated
code.

Patch is against ragel-6 branch.

Hi Rinat, does gcc suppress the error if a comment is seen, or is this 
only for a developer who looks at the warning and then code?

GCC looks into the comment and suppresses the warning based on
its text.  There are actually a number of regular expressions
that are matched against the comment. There is a more detailed
description at
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/10/wimplicit-fallthrough-in-gcc-7/

Sorry, I don't get the part about developer vs. warning.

Hi Felix, I just checked in some changes which should allow rspamd to 
compile with ragel 7. Also fixes the duplicate include. Let me know if 
you have further problems.

Hey,

now and I'd like to find out why this is (knowning next to nothing about ragel).
