<PRE>Hi Carlos,

After much thought I've decided that inline scanners are not a suitable
feature for ragel. It is a good technique but there are a few issues.

I think that calls and returns should not be encoded in a language
construct. They need to be treated with care and I'm not comfortable
with encapsulating them.

There is the issue of when to return. Since the feature would be using
the scanning machinery, one might expect to be able to match multiple
tokens as an alternative to matching just a single token. Letting the
user implement the technique allows them to chose. Also, it allows for
the option of erring when no pattern matches.

So far all the inline machine construction operators are compositional.
Inline scanners are not. For example you cannot safely union a machine
that contains an inline scanner because the call necessary to invoke it
could interfere with the other machine. This is related to the issue of
encapsulating calls and returns.

I would however be interested to add a prefix operator which would allow
you to automatically set up the machine that the call is embedded in.
The prefix operator would simply set every state final (this might have
another name in the literature). After you run the prefix operator you
could intersect it with something else to get the correct length (one in
this case).

pat = [a-z][a-z0-9]*;

inline_scanner = |*
    pat =&gt; { fret; };
    any =&gt; { fhold; fret; };
  *|;

call_pat = ( prefix(pat) &amp; any ) @{ fhold; fcall inline_scanner; };

Regards,
 Adrian
