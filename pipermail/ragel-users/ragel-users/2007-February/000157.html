<PRE>Well, take the first User Action example in the Ragel manual on page  
28: 3.1.1 Entering Action:

action A {}
main := ( lower* &gt;A ) .  ;

Let's modify it to add a Pending Out (Leaving) Action, and then make  
that machine optional:

action ENTER_TRANSITION {} # Entering Action
action LEAVE_TRANSITION {} # Pending Out (Leaving) Action

main := ( lower* &gt;ENTER_TRANSITION %LEAVE_TRANSITION )? . ' ';

If the first character recognized by main happens to be a space, then  
LEAVE will be executed, but ENTER won't.

I think it's confusing to a user that a machine will execute its  
Leaving action (to use your terminology) without first executing its  
Entering.

The confusion goes away if you've learned that the &gt; action will only  
be executed on the first character.

The % action isn't a character action, it's a machine action (to use  
my terminology). So a user would naturally reason that it could be  
executed even though no character was recognized, as is this case:

action FIRST_CHAR {} # Executed on recognition of the first character
action MACHINE_ACCEPT {} # Executed when the machine accepts a match

main := ( lower* &gt;FIRST_CHAR %MACHINE_ACCEPT )? . ' ';

I use the Match/Accept terminology because any given machine can make  
a whole bunch of matches while it's recognizing characters, and the @  
action is executed every single time the machine recognizes a match.  
The % action, on the other hand, is only executed when the machine  
finally accepts one of those matches. The @ action (Match) is a  
character action because it is always and only triggered upon the  
recognition of a character, whereas the Accept action is a machine  
action because is only ever executed once, when the machine accepts a  
match, regardless of whether or not a character has been recognized.  
It's character-independent.

Hope this explains some of the reasoning behind the categorization  
and new terminology.

Best, Erich

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Character Actions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =============
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> aka First -- This action will be executed on the first character  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the machine recognizes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt; aka Continue -- (New) This action will be executed on the next

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems that you prefer to express these operators in terms of the
</I>&gt;<i> characters of the input string that is processed. This is distinct  
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> my approach, where I talk about the transitions of a regular
</I>&gt;<i> expression's corresponding state machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer to express the operators in terms of transitions because I  
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> it to be very precise. For example, with &quot;entering transition actions&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> you can go and look at the graphviz drawing and find the transitions
</I>&gt;<i> which take you into the machine. That's me though, and I would very  
</I>&gt;<i> much
</I>&gt;<i> like to hear what others think. Is it better to talk about the
</I>&gt;<i> transitions that the actions are put into, or is better to talk about
</I>&gt;<i> the characters that are moved over when the actions are executed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt; operator you have given I find interesting. As I understand it,
</I>&gt;<i> this would embed the action on the transitions which leave final  
</I>&gt;<i> states
</I>&gt;<i> (but stay in the machine). Could you give an example of when it is  
</I>&gt;<i> useful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Machine Actions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ============
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> % aka Accept -- This action will only be executed when the machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accepts a match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The word &quot;accept&quot; I find to be somewhat ambiguous. It doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> strike me
</I>&gt;<i> that it means only one of &quot;on the last character&quot; or &quot;on the next
</I>&gt;<i> character.&quot; It seems to me that it could easily be interpreted as  
</I>&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;<i> of those. I chose the word &quot;leaving&quot; for this operator because it's
</I>&gt;<i> clear to me that it means on the next character.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %\ aka Fail -- (New) This action will only be executed when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine fails to either: (a) recognize a character, or (b) accept a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure what you mean with (b). I would assume you mean the
</I>&gt;<i> same as above, what is currently known as the leaving (or pending out)
</I>&gt;<i> operator. But then I believe this new operator would be the same as  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> $! operator. Could you clarify?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %? aka Skip -- (New) This action will be executed instead of Fail  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either the Optional operator or the Kleene Star operator is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applied to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand this operator. If you write:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( expr %? skip_act )?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it the same as writing the following?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ( expr | &quot;&quot; %skip_act )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you give us an example of the kind of problem that motivated  
</I>&gt;<i> these
</I>&gt;<i> operators? Especially the part about setting and clearing external  
</I>&gt;<i> state
</I>&gt;<i> flags to do proper resource acquisition and release. An example would
</I>&gt;<i> really help me to understand the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
