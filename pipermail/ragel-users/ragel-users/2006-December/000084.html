</I>&lt;snip&gt;

Ok, this is possible since I can also set a state variable and then alter the transition on final with an action.  There aren't a whole lot of states right now by I like the idea of making is smaller.

One thing that I believe is *kind* of missing from the state chart idea is &quot;inheriting transitions&quot;.  I don't know if I like the idea, but when I showed it to someone, they immediately thought that having a nested chart be able to let a parent chart handle common events or transitions would complete the state chart.

Oooh, kelbt looks interesting.  Downloaded it and will play with it.  My favorite parser generator is Lemon, mostly because it has insane debugging capabilities.  Please mimick Lemon this way :-)

One thing though, and more of a style choice, but I *hate* this syntax:

define conditionals
...
end define

As you mentioned, I hate repetition, so making me type &quot;define&quot; twice is really really annoying since your parser has got to be able to know that &quot;end&quot; is enough.  Especially since it looks like you can't do nesting.  Even if you can, the end keyword should be enough to close off the statement.

Anyway, i'll play with kelbt a bit.  If you're looking for a realworld use on it, I know folks looking for powerful scaner/parser combos for several open source projects.  I'll get them to try it out too.
