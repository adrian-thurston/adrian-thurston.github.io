Hi !

I tried to install ragel using macports but it seems to be broken.
Host machine is a 64bit PowerPC (G5). Here is the output :
cruby > uname -a

Ragel compiles finite state machines from regular languages into
runnable C/C++ code. Ragel state machines can not only recognize byte
sequences as regular expression machines do, but can also execute code
at arbitrary points in the recognition of a regular language.

That's a really old version. There is definitely a newer one in the  
tree so your port tree must be *way* out of date.

Run:

sudo port -d sync

This will update your tree to the latest portfiles. If you are that  
far behind on the portfiles then it is pretty likely you are running  
an old version of macports too. So I recommend you also run:

sudo port -d selfupdate

This will update macports to the latest version.

I just checked and macports has ragel-5.24 in the tree which is the  
latest release. Perform the above steps and try to install again and  
you'll probably be fine.

Oops, I think there's a missing fhold in the reset action and the two halves of the patterns could probably be concatenated. Will fix in the morning.

Better. That'll teach me to write and post ragel code late at night
after marking assembly programming assignments.

Subject: Nested brackets
Message-ID: <1194398709.442170.139590@o80g2000hse.googlegroups.com>

I'm trying to recognize JSON like structures which look like this
{hello: 'world', foo: 'bar'}
but might contain nested curly brackets or brackets inside of strings
{hello: {foo: 'bar'}}
{hello: '}', foo: 'bar'}
I don't want to parse the structure - I just want to pass over it, if
possible. Recognize where it ends. Is there a pure Ragel way of doing
this, or must I do counting?

Thanks
ry

Hi ry,

I think you have to use counting or some form of stack (e.g. ragel's
builtin fcall & fret, I use something similar for JSON but use ragel's
state charts and a custom stack) because JSON is not a regular
language.

Hi, some options:

1. Specify a growable stack using prepush and postpop and then use fcall
and fret.

2. Counting and then verify in actions or conditions.

3. Call a new parsing function (in the host language) when the recursive
structure is entered.

Hi, here is a completed version of the wide finder benchmark.

Summary: ragel + mmap + pthreads + std::map.

I don't have a multi-core machine to test on, but on a single core it
goes about 10x faster than the ruby version here:

There is an error in this which affects correctness seriously and
performance slightly. The :> operator should really be :>>. Meaning that
we stop the [^\n]* machine when the search pattern finishes, not when it
starts. In the previous version any "G" ahead of the "GET ..." will fail
the pattern.

What do you mean by unicode support? In case you have decoded from
utf8 (or some other encoding) already you probably want to work on
widechars (which should work).

In case you receive usc2/utf16 encoded unicode, i would propose
decoding that first using whatever the language you are using offers
and work on widechars when writing your parser in ragel. That
basically means that you have to specify the alphtype. Your alphtype
would then be wchar_t or unsigned long.

Hi !

I tried to install ragel using macports but it seems to be broken.
Host machine is a 64bit PowerPC (G5). Here is the output :

Ragel compiles finite state machines from regular languages into

That's a really old version. There is definitely a newer one in the  
tree so your port tree must be *way* out of date.

Run:

sudo port -d sync

This will update your tree to the latest portfiles. If you are that  
far behind on the portfiles then it is pretty likely you are running  
an old version of macports too. So I recommend you also run:

sudo port -d selfupdate

This will update macports to the latest version.

I just checked and macports has ragel-5.24 in the tree which is the  
latest release. Perform the above steps and try to install again and  
you'll probably be fine.

Oops, I think there's a missing fhold in the reset action and the two halves of the patterns could probably be concatenated. Will fix in the morning.

Better. That'll teach me to write and post ragel code late at night

Subject: Nested brackets
Message-ID: <1194398709.442170.139590@o80g2000hse.googlegroups.com>

I'm trying to recognize JSON like structures which look like this
{hello: 'world', foo: 'bar'}
but might contain nested curly brackets or brackets inside of strings
{hello: {foo: 'bar'}}
{hello: '}', foo: 'bar'}
I don't want to parse the structure - I just want to pass over it, if
possible. Recognize where it ends. Is there a pure Ragel way of doing
this, or must I do counting?

Thanks
ry

Hi ry,

I think you have to use counting or some form of stack (e.g. ragel's
builtin fcall & fret, I use something similar for JSON but use ragel's
state charts and a custom stack) because JSON is not a regular
language.

Hi, some options:

1. Specify a growable stack using prepush and postpop and then use fcall
and fret.

2. Counting and then verify in actions or conditions.

3. Call a new parsing function (in the host language) when the recursive
structure is entered.

Hi, here is a completed version of the wide finder benchmark.

Summary: ragel + mmap + pthreads + std::map.

I don't have a multi-core machine to test on, but on a single core it
goes about 10x faster than the ruby version here:

There is an error in this which affects correctness seriously and
performance slightly. The :> operator should really be :>>. Meaning that
we stop the [^\n]* machine when the search pattern finishes, not when it
starts. In the previous version any "G" ahead of the "GET ..." will fail
the pattern.

What do you mean by unicode support? In case you have decoded from
utf8 (or some other encoding) already you probably want to work on
widechars (which should work).

In case you receive usc2/utf16 encoded unicode, i would propose
decoding that first using whatever the language you are using offers
and work on widechars when writing your parser in ragel. That
basically means that you have to specify the alphtype. Your alphtype
would then be wchar_t or unsigned long.
