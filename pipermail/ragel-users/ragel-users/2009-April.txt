Hi!

I just wanted to inform you that I've just released a new open source
project using Ragel.
It's a Java implementation of the W3C Selectors Level 3 specification.
Have a look if it sounds
interesting. I'm kind of new to Ragel so tips and enhancement ideas
are most welcome.

Message-ID: <49D7D251.4060805@complang.org>

So I managed to convert Ragel to automake. If there are any automake 
experts out there (Diego?) could you have a look at it for me to see if 
I munged anything up.

There's one thing I'm not too certain about. When I configure and make a 
tarball that has been created with 'make dist', the 'make' command 
causes the project to be reconfigured. The -d option to make reveals 
that it's because aclocal.m4 is out of date. If I touch aclocal.m4 then 
the reconfigure still happens because something becomes out of date with 
respect to aclocal.m4. There seems to be a circular dependency in the 
generated files. Anyone know if I'm doing something wrong?

I've changed nothing, except the fact that now I use Linux 64 bits.

Using Ragel 6.3.1 (Ubuntu Jaunty package) I get this error:

---------------
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
ragel: rlgen-ruby did not exit normally

What does it mean?

I've updated my local copy and will see to provide some patches for a
couple of side cases; I _think_ the reconfigure problem is the changes
in the dist-hook to change the configure script, so I'll try to provide
a different method to achieve the same, similarly to what I've done in
the ragel-checking macro.

The other day I was stopped in my steps because my semi-automatic
scripts failed, out-of-tree builds don't work and aren't easy to fix
because kelbt lacks a "-I" option to tell it where to find the included
files.

That's a memory allocation error. My guess is that some allocation size 
is wrong due to some bad code with respect to 64bit. Could you provide 
the runtime options and a backtrace with gdb? First run ragel -x and 
then run the backend program manually with gdb.

Thanks,
  Adrian

The kelbt -I problem is noted.

In regards to the dist-hook, that seems to be it. I think I'll just 
modify the configure.in before running "make dist" in my release script. 
I was thinking I could get rid of the release script due to make dist, 
but I just realized I need it anyways to make the manual, sign the files 
and do a few other things.

Thanks Adrian, but I'm not sure how to check it.

I've a Ragel grammar file in Ruby (sip_parser.rl). I compile it in
Debian Etch 64 bits with Ragel 6.4 installed from sources:

# ragel -F1 -R sip_parser.rl
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
Aborted


# ragel -F1 -R sip_parser.rl -x
(I( get the internal XML)


But I don't know what you mean with "run the backend program manually
with gdb". I use gdb to debug coredumps in other programms, but have
no idea of what to do with it in this case.

Could you please indicate the steps I must perform? Thanks a lot.


PD: I've tryed this issue in two different Linux hosts both of 64 bits.

Subject: [ragel-users] Patches to avoid build_parsers=yes/no change at dist
Message-ID: <1239368159.13660.365.camel@localhost>

Just as a proof of concept now, I haven't converted the manual to the
same effect, just the parsers regeneration.

The two attached patches (from git-svn) use the same technique I used
for feng to make ragel an optional dependency for users but a mandatory
one for developers: if the generated files are missing, and either ragel
or kelbt cannot be found, the configure is aborted; if both are found,
whether the generated files exist or not, parsers regeneration is
enabled.

If this is acceptable I can make the same change to the manual
regeneration; otherwise I can add a ./configure option so that the
rebuild only happens if the files don't exist _or_ if an option is
provided to the ./configure call.

Subject: [ragel-users] eof error
Message-ID: <1239617059.8940.9.camel@x-desk>

Hello.

I'm trying to implement simple FSM describing protocol logic.

ragel gave me no errors and successfully compiled machine but I got
error from gcc while trying to compile resuls:
eof not defined.

Since I do not use such variable in .rl file I guess there is something
wrong with the way I use code generated by ragel.

Could you please take a look and point towards possible error?

Machine is quite simple (3 states, actions are just stubs doing nothing
but printing) so I'm pretty much stuck at this point.

Any general critics\recommendations are more than welcome.

best regards,
Max.

Try using -T0. My guess is that the alphabet size is large and the 
allocation of tables is eating up too much memory.

To confirm you can run:

ragel -F -R -x sip_parser.rl > out.xml
rlgen-ruby out.xml

Hmmm, I'd rather it never rebuild in the dist unless asked for. Since 
there are many different incompatible versions of Ragel, successful 
compilation will depend on what previous version you have installed. Say 
you have version four installed and you want to upgrade to version six 
then your build will fail because six's parsers can't be built with 
version four of Ragel.

Hi Max,

No error, you just need to supply eof since there is a final state with 
an action to execute on the EOF event. In this case it's caused by the 
error action in the Enumerator machine and would also be caused by the 
leaving action applied to Enumerator if Enumerator had any final states. 
You just need to tell Ragel when it's got to the end of the input by 
setting char *eof = pe.

If so, is it a bug or a problem in my grammar?

PD: Note that it worked fine in 32 bits (same grammar, some Ragel version).

The most common cause for this is a cast to a long or unsigned long,
where size_t should be used.

I still have version 1.52, from 2003, installed for one application.
Once our software has going through
a validation cycle the tools don't change, unless there is a compleing
reason to do so.  Obviously new applications get the new versions.

Using NTFS Junctions can help with the differing version issue on Windows,
like sym-links on other systems.

Subject: [ragel-users] Reading from stream instead of buffer
Message-ID: <20090417142446.GD32208@pruts.nl>


Hello List,

Tody I discoverd Ragel, and I'm trying to create a small parser for
reading a binary protocol. The databytes are read from a serial port,
and only the parser will know when packets are complete. This makes it
hard to read data into a buffer first, since the underlying code does
not have any protocol knowledge.

Is there a way to make ragel read bytes from a stream, e.g. instead of
using the *p and *pe pointers, I'd like to have a function called by
ragel to receive data from the serial drivere, similar to the ANSI C
getchar() function.

Regards,

Ico

You can execute on one character at a time.

while (true)
{
     int c = getchar();
     if ( c == EOF )
         break;

     char cv = c;
     char *p = &cv;
     char *pe = p + 1;

     %%write exec;
}

I have a new solution: use the dist-hook like before but this time use 
"cp -p" and "touch -r" to reset the modified times of the configure.in 
and configure files after they are modified. This fixes the reconfigure 
on make issue from before.

I don't think these options are portable to older UNIX systems but my 
rationale is that "make dist" is a maintainer command anyways, and it 
isn't necessary to use it just to get ragel built and working on an 
older system.

Ah yes, I figured this out eventually, but I was bitten by using the

Hi,

What's the best way to search a buffer for a list of patterns using ragel?

I've tried:

search = A | B | C;

main := any* search;

which works ok but generates a lot of states.

I've also tried using a scanner like:

main := |*
    A;
    B;
    C;
    any;
*|;

which also works and generates much fewer states, but I'm not interested in
writing extra code to handle te, ts, eof etc.

Subject: [ragel-users] ragel scanner construct question
Message-ID: <7237ED89-02DB-4E89-9D1D-5644AA7473F5@mac.com>

I am experimenting with ragel to validate and tokenize an algebraic  
expression in one step.  Basically convert something like "3 + A * 2 /  
( 1 - 5 )" to "[3.0, 'A' , 2.0, :*, 1.0, 5.0, :-, :/, :+]" if it's  
valid, and throw an error otherwise. I'm using the ruby target, and  
the standard "shunting yard" algorithm or whatever.

I have the thing working (I think, still testing) by using the scanner  
construct and making an "allowed transition" table by hand.  Each of  
the tokenizing actions validates against this table to see whether it  
should continue.  It seems to me that there is probably a nice way to  
do this within ragel itself but I can't seem to figure it out.  Can  
somebody point me in the right direction?

the files are up on github: http://github.com/prakatmac/expression-parser/tree/master

Sorry if this is a dumb question.  I'm pretty new at this stuff.   
Thanks.

There's no best way, you just have to choose one that works for you. The 
alternative to the two methods you tried is to manually run the machine 
( A | B | C ) at every position in the input. As soon as it fails it 
will stop so you won't get N^2 running time. This is very much like 
using a scanner. You'll have to keep data around though. You can't do 
that on one pass of the data for the same reason you need to do some 
management of ts, te, etc. for a scanner.

You can't do that in Ragel. To understand why you'll have to do some 
reading on context-free VS regular languages. Pick up a compiler book. 
It's a big topic.

I understand that an algebraic expression can be described by a  
context free grammar and not by a regular grammar (I thought due to  
the recursive requirement).  However, i'm only referring to the  
validation of the next symbol.  All I want to express within ragel is  
that within the buffer, "2 3" shouldn't match since it doesn't make  
sense for a number to be directly followed by another number whereas  
"2 +" or "2 )" would make sense.  I can see doing this via the  
lookahead strategy you talk about in the manual, but that seems to be  
a little excessive.  It just seems like all I am making use of to  
implement this portion is a next-state table so it can't be so off the  
wall.  Am I still totally off the mark?

~pramukta

also, is the dragon book still the best place to look for this stuff?

Oh, my bad. In that case yes! You can do something like this.

word = [a-z];
number = [0-9];

token = word | number;
op = '+' | '-' | '*' | '\\';

OWS = [ \t\r\n]*;

main := OWS token OWS ( op OWS token OWS )*;

Subject: [ragel-users] Best practice: using ragel for bit-based state
	machines on	microcontroller?
Message-ID: <1240948143.28562.12.camel@my.sporbeck-family.de>

Hello there!

I'd like to use ragel to design the state machine for a microcontroller
project (avr atmega8535) written in C.

I think I understand how to use it for streams of char, int, etc. But
what's the best practice to use for bit based decisions?

I could use union..struct to pack all bits in one datatype and process
that. But I doubt that'll yield a performant implementation.

I read messages on this list that ragel is used for uC projects, but no
details how.

So any hints or example code to get me started is appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
/Jan.

You don't have enough space in 8535 to do all of that.  Set each
byte as  bool in the struct.

Depends on the compiler.  If you are using GCC you have to use Ragel
in 'goto' format.  The tables will not work without futher processing.
This does make the code a lot larger.  It would be better to write the software
before you pick the processor, something with more memory is usually a better
choice, than the old 8535 parts.

If you are using the IAR compiler tables probably will work ok, don't
know for sure as I try to avoid IAR when I can.  Don't know the state
of Imagecraft's table handling today, been long time since I used them.

Sorry, boss would not like me giveing out our code.

Hi!

I just wanted to inform you that I've just released a new open source
project using Ragel.
It's a Java implementation of the W3C Selectors Level 3 specification.
Have a look if it sounds
interesting. I'm kind of new to Ragel so tips and enhancement ideas
are most welcome.

Subject: [ragel-users] ragel and automake
Message-ID: <49D7D251.4060805@complang.org>

So I managed to convert Ragel to automake. If there are any automake 
experts out there (Diego?) could you have a look at it for me to see if 
I munged anything up.

There's one thing I'm not too certain about. When I configure and make a 
tarball that has been created with 'make dist', the 'make' command 
causes the project to be reconfigured. The -d option to make reveals 
that it's because aclocal.m4 is out of date. If I touch aclocal.m4 then 
the reconfigure still happens because something becomes out of date with 
respect to aclocal.m4. There seems to be a circular dependency in the 
generated files. Anyone know if I'm doing something wrong?

I've updated my local copy and will see to provide some patches for a
couple of side cases; I _think_ the reconfigure problem is the changes
in the dist-hook to change the configure script, so I'll try to provide
a different method to achieve the same, similarly to what I've done in
the ragel-checking macro.

The other day I was stopped in my steps because my semi-automatic
scripts failed, out-of-tree builds don't work and aren't easy to fix
because kelbt lacks a "-I" option to tell it where to find the included
files.

That's a memory allocation error. My guess is that some allocation size 
is wrong due to some bad code with respect to 64bit. Could you provide 
the runtime options and a backtrace with gdb? First run ragel -x and 
then run the backend program manually with gdb.

Thanks,

The kelbt -I problem is noted.

In regards to the dist-hook, that seems to be it. I think I'll just 
modify the configure.in before running "make dist" in my release script. 
I was thinking I could get rid of the release script due to make dist, 
but I just realized I need it anyways to make the manual, sign the files 
and do a few other things.

Thanks Adrian, but I'm not sure how to check it.

I've a Ragel grammar file in Ruby (sip_parser.rl). I compile it in
Debian Etch 64 bits with Ragel 6.4 installed from sources:

# ragel -F1 -R sip_parser.rl
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  St9bad_alloc
Aborted


# ragel -F1 -R sip_parser.rl -x
(I( get the internal XML)


But I don't know what you mean with "run the backend program manually
with gdb". I use gdb to debug coredumps in other programms, but have
no idea of what to do with it in this case.

Could you please indicate the steps I must perform? Thanks a lot.


PD: I've tryed this issue in two different Linux hosts both of 64 bits.

Subject: [ragel-users] Patches to avoid build_parsers=yes/no change at dist
Message-ID: <1239368159.13660.365.camel@localhost>

Just as a proof of concept now, I haven't converted the manual to the
same effect, just the parsers regeneration.

The two attached patches (from git-svn) use the same technique I used
for feng to make ragel an optional dependency for users but a mandatory
one for developers: if the generated files are missing, and either ragel
or kelbt cannot be found, the configure is aborted; if both are found,
whether the generated files exist or not, parsers regeneration is
enabled.

If this is acceptable I can make the same change to the manual
regeneration; otherwise I can add a ./configure option so that the
rebuild only happens if the files don't exist _or_ if an option is
provided to the ./configure call.

Subject: [ragel-users] eof error
Message-ID: <1239617059.8940.9.camel@x-desk>

Hello.

I'm trying to implement simple FSM describing protocol logic.

ragel gave me no errors and successfully compiled machine but I got
error from gcc while trying to compile resuls:
eof not defined.

Since I do not use such variable in .rl file I guess there is something
wrong with the way I use code generated by ragel.

Could you please take a look and point towards possible error?

Machine is quite simple (3 states, actions are just stubs doing nothing
but printing) so I'm pretty much stuck at this point.

Any general critics\recommendations are more than welcome.

best regards,
Max.

Try using -T0. My guess is that the alphabet size is large and the 
allocation of tables is eating up too much memory.

To confirm you can run:

ragel -F -R -x sip_parser.rl > out.xml
rlgen-ruby out.xml

Hmmm, I'd rather it never rebuild in the dist unless asked for. Since 
there are many different incompatible versions of Ragel, successful 
compilation will depend on what previous version you have installed. Say 
you have version four installed and you want to upgrade to version six 
then your build will fail because six's parsers can't be built with 
version four of Ragel.

Hi Max,

No error, you just need to supply eof since there is a final state with 
an action to execute on the EOF event. In this case it's caused by the 
error action in the Enumerator machine and would also be caused by the 
leaving action applied to Enumerator if Enumerator had any final states. 
You just need to tell Ragel when it's got to the end of the input by 
setting char *eof = pe.

If so, is it a bug or a problem in my grammar?

~# ragel -T0 -R sip_parser.rl -o sip_parser.rb
ragel: rubycodegen.cpp:372: std::string RubyCodeGen::WIDE_ALPH_TYPE():

After compiling Ragel 6.4 I have no rlgen-XXXX command.

PD: Note that it worked fine in 32 bits (same grammar, some Ragel version).

The most common cause for this is a cast to a long or unsigned long,
where size_t should be used.

I still have version 1.52, from 2003, installed for one application.
Once our software has going through
a validation cycle the tools don't change, unless there is a compleing
reason to do so.  Obviously new applications get the new versions.

Using NTFS Junctions can help with the differing version issue on Windows,
like sym-links on other systems.

Subject: [ragel-users] Reading from stream instead of buffer
Message-ID: <20090417142446.GD32208@pruts.nl>


Hello List,

Tody I discoverd Ragel, and I'm trying to create a small parser for
reading a binary protocol. The databytes are read from a serial port,
and only the parser will know when packets are complete. This makes it
hard to read data into a buffer first, since the underlying code does
not have any protocol knowledge.

Is there a way to make ragel read bytes from a stream, e.g. instead of
using the *p and *pe pointers, I'd like to have a function called by
ragel to receive data from the serial drivere, similar to the ANSI C
getchar() function.

Regards,

Ico

You can execute on one character at a time.

while (true)
{
     int c = getchar();
     if ( c == EOF )
         break;

     char cv = c;
     char *p = &cv;
     char *pe = p + 1;

     %%write exec;
}

I have a new solution: use the dist-hook like before but this time use 
"cp -p" and "touch -r" to reset the modified times of the configure.in 
and configure files after they are modified. This fixes the reconfigure 
on make issue from before.

I don't think these options are portable to older UNIX systems but my 
rationale is that "make dist" is a maintainer command anyways, and it 
isn't necessary to use it just to get ragel built and working on an 
older system.

Ah yes, I figured this out eventually, but I was bitten by using the
wrong alphtype which caused me other troubles.

Message-ID: <3703f4460904201445n1b3b8a36g4603dc29c91561c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What's the best way to search a buffer for a list of patterns using ragel?

I've tried:

search = A | B | C;

main := any* search;

which works ok but generates a lot of states.

I've also tried using a scanner like:

main := |*
    A;
    B;
    C;
    any;
*|;

which also works and generates much fewer states, but I'm not interested in
writing extra code to handle te, ts, eof etc.

Message-ID: <7237ED89-02DB-4E89-9D1D-5644AA7473F5@mac.com>

I am experimenting with ragel to validate and tokenize an algebraic  
expression in one step.  Basically convert something like "3 + A * 2 /  
( 1 - 5 )" to "[3.0, 'A' , 2.0, :*, 1.0, 5.0, :-, :/, :+]" if it's  
valid, and throw an error otherwise. I'm using the ruby target, and  
the standard "shunting yard" algorithm or whatever.

I have the thing working (I think, still testing) by using the scanner  
construct and making an "allowed transition" table by hand.  Each of  
the tokenizing actions validates against this table to see whether it  
should continue.  It seems to me that there is probably a nice way to  
do this within ragel itself but I can't seem to figure it out.  Can  
somebody point me in the right direction?

Sorry if this is a dumb question.  I'm pretty new at this stuff.   
Thanks.

There's no best way, you just have to choose one that works for you. The 
alternative to the two methods you tried is to manually run the machine 
( A | B | C ) at every position in the input. As soon as it fails it 
will stop so you won't get N^2 running time. This is very much like 
using a scanner. You'll have to keep data around though. You can't do 
that on one pass of the data for the same reason you need to do some 
management of ts, te, etc. for a scanner.

You can't do that in Ragel. To understand why you'll have to do some 
reading on context-free VS regular languages. Pick up a compiler book. 
It's a big topic.

I understand that an algebraic expression can be described by a  
context free grammar and not by a regular grammar (I thought due to  
the recursive requirement).  However, i'm only referring to the  
validation of the next symbol.  All I want to express within ragel is  
that within the buffer, "2 3" shouldn't match since it doesn't make  
sense for a number to be directly followed by another number whereas  
"2 +" or "2 )" would make sense.  I can see doing this via the  
lookahead strategy you talk about in the manual, but that seems to be  
a little excessive.  It just seems like all I am making use of to  
implement this portion is a next-state table so it can't be so off the  
wall.  Am I still totally off the mark?

~pramukta

also, is the dragon book still the best place to look for this stuff?

Oh, my bad. In that case yes! You can do something like this.

word = [a-z];
number = [0-9];

token = word | number;
op = '+' | '-' | '*' | '\\';

OWS = [ \t\r\n]*;

main := OWS token OWS ( op OWS token OWS )*;

Message-ID: <1240948143.28562.12.camel@my.sporbeck-family.de>

Hello there!

I'd like to use ragel to design the state machine for a microcontroller
project (avr atmega8535) written in C.

I think I understand how to use it for streams of char, int, etc. But
what's the best practice to use for bit based decisions?

I could use union..struct to pack all bits in one datatype and process
that. But I doubt that'll yield a performant implementation.

I read messages on this list that ragel is used for uC projects, but no
details how.

So any hints or example code to get me started is appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
/Jan.

You don't have enough space in 8535 to do all of that.  Set each
byte as  bool in the struct.

Depends on the compiler.  If you are using GCC you have to use Ragel
in 'goto' format.  The tables will not work without futher processing.
This does make the code a lot larger.  It would be better to write the software
before you pick the processor, something with more memory is usually a better
choice, than the old 8535 parts.

If you are using the IAR compiler tables probably will work ok, don't
know for sure as I try to avoid IAR when I can.  Don't know the state
of Imagecraft's table handling today, been long time since I used them.

Sorry, boss would not like me giveing out our code.
