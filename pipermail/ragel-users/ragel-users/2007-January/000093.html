<PRE>Hi Adrian,

Cool. I think I'd figured that out intuitively but not on a conscious level.

Ah.

&gt;<i> There is no character to cause the action to get executed. If you embed

Zed prompted me to look at write eof, but I misread the guide and
didn't realise you had to embed specific EOF actions. I guess using
Ruby so much has lead me to expect magic everywhere ;-)

&gt;<i> You can try it out with something simple like the following. I find the

Good point.

&gt;<i>         sub = ( 's' [^\n]* '\n' ) %e1 %eof e1;
</I>
%eof, isn't that another action the same as %e1?  When I looked
through the 5.16 guide about EOF actions it suggested I should use %/
(maybe %eof is alternative syntax? I couldn't find it when I
searched).

Anyway I tried:

hunk = hunkHeader &gt;enter_hunk hunkBody %exit_hunk %/exit_hunk;
	
	fileName = ( lineChar+ ) &gt;mark %copy_to_filespec;
	
	fileSpec = &quot;Index:&quot; nbsp+ fileName '\n'+;
	
	diffHeader = ( fileSpec separator oldFile newFile );
	diffBody = hunk* %exit_diff %/exit_diff;

and it worked first time out (since I already had the %% write eof, it
just wasn't doing anything!)

&gt;<i> ( ignoreCode | hunkEndChar @{ fhold; } );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I removed the lookahead as you suggested. I'll consume the \\ prefixed
comment inside 'line' from now on.

&gt;<i> In general, it's advisable to avoid fhold unless you're about to jump
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere using fgoto or you're really sure of what you're doing. The

Yeah I think we can safely say I don't *quite* know what I'm doing
yet. But I do feel like I'm getting, slowly, to grips with it. I think
that part of my problem is that I'm not a visual thinker, I can't
imagine the resulting graph as I'm constructing the machine. I
probably need to be a bit less sloppy in my reasoning to compensate
;-)

So, this morning, I have:
