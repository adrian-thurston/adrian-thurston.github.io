Hi, does this do what you want?

main = (
           ('HELLO ' $^parse_error) 'WORLD' |
           any*
        );

I'm not sure how that fits into your overall plan. Try it out and we'll 
discuss further.

Regards,
  Adrian

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for taking an interest :-).


As far as I can tell,

 main = (
          ('HELLO ' $^parse_error) 'WORLD' |
          any*
       );

and

 main = (
          ('HELLO ' $!parse_error) 'WORLD' |
          any*
       );

are equivalent to


 main = any*;




Anyway, the real machine I am trying to build currently looks like this:


doctype_single_quoted_value = (
    "'" ([^>]*)
        >start_token_value
        %end_token
    :>> "'"
);

doctype_double_quoted_value = (
    '"' ([^>]*)
        >start_token_value
        %end_token
    :>> '"'
);

doctype_quoted_value = (doctype_single_quoted_value |
doctype_double_quoted_value);

doctype_name = (
    space+ (any - ('>' | space))+
        >start_token_doctype_name
        %end_token
);

doctype_public = space+ 'PUBLIC' %token_doctype_public space+
doctype_quoted_value;

doctype_system = space+ 'SYSTEM' %token_doctype_system space+
doctype_quoted_value;

doctype = (
    '<!DOCTYPE' %token_doctype space* (doctype_name doctype_public?
doctype_system?)? space* '>'
);



This machine looks about right (in the FSM diagram) except that it
doesn't handle malformed doctypes.

With the $^^ operator I described, I imagine the machine would look
like this (given a parse error action, pe):



doctype = (
    '<!DOCTYPE' %token_doctype space* ((doctype_name doctype_public?
doctype_system?) $^^pe)? space* <: ([^>]+ >pe)? '>'
);


Additionally, I think I might be able to use that imaginary operator
to make whitespace optional (though with a parse error if the
whitespace is omitted):

eg:

omittable_space = space+ >^^pe;
doctype_public = omittable_space 'PUBLIC' %token_doctype_public
omittable_space doctype_quoted_value;




I will be using this machine inside multiple scanners, so goto based
error recovery would be a pain. Default actions that transition to the
final state seem like a handy feature for any permissive parser
(although I realize I am doing something extreme).

I still thinking about attempting to patch ragel. Much more
complicated than I thought it would be, but can't hurt for me to give
it a crack.


Still absolutely nowhere near finished, but my work is progressing slowly ;-).

Apparently I don't know how to use my own tool! Let's try this again, 
this time not so rushed on my part :)

         action le {}
         foo = 'hello' $^le;
         main := (
                 any* |
                 foo
         );

Local error actions are local to the named machine they are in, not the 
enclosing (), which is the rushed mistake I made.

Thanks,
  Adrian

Subject: [ragel-users] [PATCH] Suppress #line output for Ruby code generation
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=bb1W=CzFj-gX0KM4fSsz+P2Zik_WFtSd2ghXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Not sure if this is the right place to send patches, but I didn't see
anything that looked more appropriate on
http://www.complang.org/ragel/.  (Of course, if I missed it, let me
know.)

The attached patch contains three changes:

(1) Implementation of the -L option for Ruby code generation by
suppressing all "# line ..." output.  This isn't the same thing as
what the C/D code generator does, but IMO is the closest
interpretation for Ruby code.  The patch is modelled after the
existing behavior for C/D code generation.
(2) A change to the option listing to signal Ruby as a target language
for which -L is available.
(3) A change that corrects a typo in the option listing ("direcives"
-> "directives").

The patch was generated using git diff, but should apply cleanly with
e.g. GNU patch.

Suggestions and comments welcome.

Thanks,

- David

Hi David,

Yes this is the right place. Thank you for your submission. The mailing 
list has always been low volume and special purpose lists aren't really 
warranted.

The issue is now tracked in the new redmine instance I've started using 
for my open source projects.

Regards,
  Adrian

Subject: [ragel-users] longest matching kleene star & parse error
Message-ID: <AANLkTikXJa+_5suCFbTrG_BBOoUmvZCrnPue7L8JHriL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to write a simple html lexer with ragel.
I have something looking like this, to match and take an action on the
attribute 'src=' potentially found in several tag attributes :

  tag_content = (
        ('src='i  ((('\'' string_sgl_exp) | '"' string_dbl_exp)
                      >src_attr_start
                      @src_attr_end))

        | any
    )** <>lerr{  };

    tag_exp = tag_content :>> '>';

My problem is if I create an attribute <img srt="..."> (srt is not a proper
attribute, but it does generate a parse error).
What I'd like to do would be <>lerr{ fhold; fgoto tag_content; }, which
would work if tag_content was an entry point.
But I use tag_exp in several places where an entry point wouldn't work, for
instance :

img_tag := tag_exp [...] @end_img_action;
script_tag := tag_exp [...] @end_script_tag_action;

I've considered creating a ragel scanner, but I don't really care for
backtracking, I'd just like to be able to hide the error. This would work
exactly the way I want to, by doing a fgoto tag_content. It would basically
restart the parse on t='...' and have it would fall under the "any"
category.

Is there an elegant way to do this, or to just hide the error ?

Thank you,

Matthieu.

Sorry I don't have anything elegant for you. You'll have to factor out 
and duplicate the error action.

Subject: [ragel-users] Split ragel source files to several and include one
	to other
Message-ID: <AANLkTik6u+Mx4CgrWwb2pOyvwuYfUDQ1JBTFHOZoF9cY@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I try to use ragel in the open-source project "Percona-Playback":
https://code.launchpad.net/~tsarev/percona-playback/alpha
Ragel is great compliant to my targets.

But I have trouble what can't solve and documentation not answer to my
question.
So I read parts 2.1.4, but don't understand how its work

Suppose I have one machine (thread_id.rl file):
{{%
    machine thread_id;
    action thread_id_begin { thread_id= 0; }
    action thread_id_step  { thread_id= thread_id * 10 + (fc - '0'); }
    action thread_id_end   { set_thread_id(thread_id); }
    key   = 'Thread_id: ';
    value = ([0-9] @thread_id_step;)+ %thread_id_end;
    main := (key @thread_id_begin) . value;
%}}

Now i want two things:
1) Write unit test to this machine
2) Use this machine to another, more complex machine.

I tried to include this machine in another file:
%%{
    machine thread_id_test;
    error = [^\n]* '\n'
      >{ std::cout << "start skip: '"; }
      ${ std::cout << fc; }
      @{ std::cout < "'\n" << std::flush; fgoto main; };
    thread_id= include thread_id "../../src/parser/thread_id.rl";
    main := (thread_id | error)*;
    write data;
}%%

but receive error:
[ 69%] Generating thread_id_test.cc
/storage/project/playback/head/test/parser/thread_id_test.rl:39:10: at token
TK_ColonEquals: parse error

I tried another way:
%%{
    machine thread_id_test;
    include thread_id "../../src/parser/thread_id.rl";
    error = [^\n]* '\n'
      >{ std::cout << "start skip: '"; }
      ${ std::cout << fc; }
      @{ std::cout < "'\n" << std::flush; fgoto main; };
    main := (thread_id | error)*;
    write data;
}%%

but get another error:
[ 69%] Generating thread_id_test.cc
/storage/project/playback/head/test/parser/thread_id_test.rl:39:14: graph
lookup of "thread_id" failed

Thank you very much for any help.

Best regards, Oleg

Hi Oleg,

When you 'include' one machine into another, the first machine's
actions and states become available to the new one. But it can't find
the 'thread_id' state (because there is none), so it fails. You've got
the right idea with your second try, but you need there to be a
thread_id -state- you can reference:

----
{{%
    machine thread_id;
    action thread_id_begin { thread_id= 0; }
    action thread_id_step  { thread_id= thread_id * 10 + (fc - '0'); }
    action thread_id_end   { set_thread_id(thread_id); }

    key   = 'Thread_id: ';
    value = ([0-9] @thread_id_step;)+ %thread_id_end;

    thread_id = (key @thread_id_begin) . value;

    main := thread_id;
%}}
----

Factoring out 'main' into its own named state lets you use it from
another machine. Now, when you try to use the thread_id state from
your second machine, the lookup is successful. If you don't use the
thread_id machine directly and just include it into other machines,
you don't need the 'main' definition there, either.

The above code is untested, but I did more or less the same thing with
my Telnet parser [1][2].

Hope that helps,

Subject: [ragel-users] code review
Message-ID: <AANLkTikR7zgXb_7oegVd9ypaJCGQX+eK6rRnt++_+qtW@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Ragel to parse a DSL for grid-based GUI layouts. What I have is
working, but I'm not sure it is done well. I would love feedback on how it
can be improved. I generated a graph with Graphviz... it was 10mb and
32767x5625 pixels, which makes me think maybe I'm not doing this right.

My Ragel file:
http://code.google.com/p/table-layout/source/browse/trunk/build/TableLayoutParser.rl

My project, with a description of the language:
http://code.google.com/p/table-layout/

The language is hierarchical. I'm using fjump/fret to handle that. Also,
FWIW, I chose Ragel over JavaCC and ANTLR because I like the small amount of
code generated. I also don't like that ANTLR has a runtime dependency.

Thanks!
-Nate

Hi, does this do what you want?

main = (
           ('HELLO ' $^parse_error) 'WORLD' |
           any*
        );

I'm not sure how that fits into your overall plan. Try it out and we'll 
discuss further.

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for taking an interest :-).


As far as I can tell,

 main = (
          ('HELLO ' $^parse_error) 'WORLD' |
          any*
       );

and

 main = (
          ('HELLO ' $!parse_error) 'WORLD' |
          any*
       );

are equivalent to


 main = any*;




Anyway, the real machine I am trying to build currently looks like this:


doctype_single_quoted_value = (
    "'" ([^>]*)
        >start_token_value
        %end_token
    :>> "'"
);

doctype_double_quoted_value = (
    '"' ([^>]*)
        >start_token_value
        %end_token
    :>> '"'
);

doctype_quoted_value = (doctype_single_quoted_value |
doctype_double_quoted_value);

doctype_name = (
    space+ (any - ('>' | space))+
        >start_token_doctype_name
        %end_token
);

doctype_public = space+ 'PUBLIC' %token_doctype_public space+
doctype_quoted_value;

doctype_system = space+ 'SYSTEM' %token_doctype_system space+
doctype_quoted_value;

doctype = (
    '<!DOCTYPE' %token_doctype space* (doctype_name doctype_public?
doctype_system?)? space* '>'
);



This machine looks about right (in the FSM diagram) except that it
doesn't handle malformed doctypes.

With the $^^ operator I described, I imagine the machine would look
like this (given a parse error action, pe):



doctype = (
    '<!DOCTYPE' %token_doctype space* ((doctype_name doctype_public?
doctype_system?) $^^pe)? space* <: ([^>]+ >pe)? '>'
);


Additionally, I think I might be able to use that imaginary operator
to make whitespace optional (though with a parse error if the
whitespace is omitted):

eg:

omittable_space = space+ >^^pe;
doctype_public = omittable_space 'PUBLIC' %token_doctype_public
omittable_space doctype_quoted_value;




I will be using this machine inside multiple scanners, so goto based
error recovery would be a pain. Default actions that transition to the
final state seem like a handy feature for any permissive parser
(although I realize I am doing something extreme).

I still thinking about attempting to patch ragel. Much more
complicated than I thought it would be, but can't hurt for me to give
it a crack.


Still absolutely nowhere near finished, but my work is progressing slowly ;-).

Apparently I don't know how to use my own tool! Let's try this again, 
this time not so rushed on my part :)

         action le {}
         foo = 'hello' $^le;
         main := (
                 any* |
                 foo
         );

Local error actions are local to the named machine they are in, not the 
enclosing (), which is the rushed mistake I made.

Thanks,
  Adrian

Thanks Adrian, I think that technique will make it possible to solve my problem.

Subject: [ragel-users] [PATCH] Suppress #line output for Ruby code generation
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=bb1W=CzFj-gX0KM4fSsz+P2Zik_WFtSd2ghXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Not sure if this is the right place to send patches, but I didn't see
anything that looked more appropriate on
http://www.complang.org/ragel/.  (Of course, if I missed it, let me
know.)

The attached patch contains three changes:

(1) Implementation of the -L option for Ruby code generation by
suppressing all "# line ..." output.  This isn't the same thing as
what the C/D code generator does, but IMO is the closest
interpretation for Ruby code.  The patch is modelled after the
existing behavior for C/D code generation.
(2) A change to the option listing to signal Ruby as a target language
for which -L is available.
(3) A change that corrects a typo in the option listing ("direcives"
-> "directives").

The patch was generated using git diff, but should apply cleanly with
e.g. GNU patch.

Suggestions and comments welcome.

Thanks,

- David

Hi David,

Yes this is the right place. Thank you for your submission. The mailing 
list has always been low volume and special purpose lists aren't really 
warranted.

The issue is now tracked in the new redmine instance I've started using 
for my open source projects.

http://www.complang.org/redmine/issues/155

Regards,
  Adrian

Subject: [ragel-users] longest matching kleene star & parse error
Message-ID: <AANLkTikXJa+_5suCFbTrG_BBOoUmvZCrnPue7L8JHriL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to write a simple html lexer with ragel.
I have something looking like this, to match and take an action on the
attribute 'src=' potentially found in several tag attributes :

  tag_content = (
        ('src='i  ((('\'' string_sgl_exp) | '"' string_dbl_exp)
                      >src_attr_start
                      @src_attr_end))

        | any
    )** <>lerr{  };

    tag_exp = tag_content :>> '>';

My problem is if I create an attribute <img srt="..."> (srt is not a proper
attribute, but it does generate a parse error).
What I'd like to do would be <>lerr{ fhold; fgoto tag_content; }, which
would work if tag_content was an entry point.
But I use tag_exp in several places where an entry point wouldn't work, for
instance :

img_tag := tag_exp [...] @end_img_action;
script_tag := tag_exp [...] @end_script_tag_action;

I've considered creating a ragel scanner, but I don't really care for
backtracking, I'd just like to be able to hide the error. This would work
exactly the way I want to, by doing a fgoto tag_content. It would basically
restart the parse on t='...' and have it would fall under the "any"
category.

Is there an elegant way to do this, or to just hide the error ?

Thank you,

Matthieu.

Sorry I don't have anything elegant for you. You'll have to factor out 
and duplicate the error action.

Subject: [ragel-users] Split ragel source files to several and include one
	to other
Message-ID: <AANLkTik6u+Mx4CgrWwb2pOyvwuYfUDQ1JBTFHOZoF9cY@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I try to use ragel in the open-source project "Percona-Playback":
https://code.launchpad.net/~tsarev/percona-playback/alpha
Ragel is great compliant to my targets.

But I have trouble what can't solve and documentation not answer to my
question.
So I read parts 2.1.4, but don't understand how its work

Suppose I have one machine (thread_id.rl file):
{{%
    machine thread_id;
    action thread_id_begin { thread_id= 0; }
    action thread_id_step  { thread_id= thread_id * 10 + (fc - '0'); }
    action thread_id_end   { set_thread_id(thread_id); }
    key   = 'Thread_id: ';
    value = ([0-9] @thread_id_step;)+ %thread_id_end;
    main := (key @thread_id_begin) . value;
%}}

Now i want two things:
1) Write unit test to this machine
2) Use this machine to another, more complex machine.

I tried to include this machine in another file:
%%{
    machine thread_id_test;
    error = [^\n]* '\n'
      >{ std::cout << "start skip: '"; }
      ${ std::cout << fc; }
      @{ std::cout < "'\n" << std::flush; fgoto main; };
    thread_id= include thread_id "../../src/parser/thread_id.rl";
    main := (thread_id | error)*;
    write data;
}%%

but receive error:
[ 69%] Generating thread_id_test.cc
/storage/project/playback/head/test/parser/thread_id_test.rl:39:10: at token
TK_ColonEquals: parse error

I tried another way:
%%{
    machine thread_id_test;
    include thread_id "../../src/parser/thread_id.rl";
    error = [^\n]* '\n'
      >{ std::cout << "start skip: '"; }
      ${ std::cout << fc; }
      @{ std::cout < "'\n" << std::flush; fgoto main; };
    main := (thread_id | error)*;
    write data;
}%%

but get another error:
[ 69%] Generating thread_id_test.cc
/storage/project/playback/head/test/parser/thread_id_test.rl:39:14: graph
lookup of "thread_id" failed

Thank you very much for any help.

Best regards, Oleg

Hi Oleg,

When you 'include' one machine into another, the first machine's
actions and states become available to the new one. But it can't find
the 'thread_id' state (because there is none), so it fails. You've got
the right idea with your second try, but you need there to be a
thread_id -state- you can reference:

----
{{%
    machine thread_id;
    action thread_id_begin { thread_id= 0; }
    action thread_id_step  { thread_id= thread_id * 10 + (fc - '0'); }
    action thread_id_end   { set_thread_id(thread_id); }

    key   = 'Thread_id: ';
    value = ([0-9] @thread_id_step;)+ %thread_id_end;

    thread_id = (key @thread_id_begin) . value;

    main := thread_id;
%}}
----

Factoring out 'main' into its own named state lets you use it from
another machine. Now, when you try to use the thread_id state from
your second machine, the lookup is successful. If you don't use the
thread_id machine directly and just include it into other machines,
you don't need the 'main' definition there, either.

The above code is untested, but I did more or less the same thing with
my Telnet parser [1][2].

Hope that helps,

Subject: [ragel-users] code review

Hi,

I am using Ragel to parse a DSL for grid-based GUI layouts. What I have is
working, but I'm not sure it is done well. I would love feedback on how it
can be improved. I generated a graph with Graphviz... it was 10mb and
32767x5625 pixels, which makes me think maybe I'm not doing this right.

My Ragel file:
http://code.google.com/p/table-layout/source/browse/trunk/build/TableLayoutParser.rl

My project, with a description of the language:
http://code.google.com/p/table-layout/

The language is hierarchical. I'm using fjump/fret to handle that. Also,
FWIW, I chose Ragel over JavaCC and ANTLR because I like the small amount of
code generated. I also don't like that ANTLR has a runtime dependency.

Thanks!
-Nate
