Subject: [ragel-users] compile issue on platforms with char being unsigned
	by default
Message-ID: <75a2397c-d612-694c-0b1e-32afde9f4086@boomerangsworld.de>

Hi,

I got a report for a project of mine that compilation does not work on
platforms where the C type "char" is unsigned by default. The problem is
within a file generated with ragel 7.0.0.10 (but 7.0.0.11 behaves the same).

The array *trans_cond_spaces is of type const char[] but contains a lot
of -1. This will lead to a compiler error: narrowing conversion of ‘-1’
from ‘int’ to ‘char’ inside...

I have attached a small (stripped-down) example which does not do
anything useful but triggers the problem.

Steps to reproduce:

$ ragel test.rl -o test.cc
$ g++ -funsigned-char test.cc -c

g++ is 7.3.1.

I don't want to compile a selected file with "-fsigned-char"  and all
the rest with the default behavior so my current workaround is to patch
the array to be of type "signed char[]". Since this is the intended
behavior anyway may I suggest to change the generated output to use
signed char? I don't know if any of the other arrays may contain
negative values as well.

Feedback is very welcome, maybe there is also some other way around this
problem.

Best regards,

Ralf

Thanks for the report Ralf. Part of a push of work that needs to be done 
on cross compilation and types before 7.0 final.

I noticed that there were a few issues trying to compile Ragel with VC++ 
and/or CMake, including but not limited to the use of GCC-specific 
extensions and CMake build scripts failing to compile all necessary 
files. I was wondering if patches would be welcome in trying to fix 
those issues. In addition, I was wondering the best method of submitting 
said patches assuming patches are welcome.

Thanks, Zach

Hi Zachary, yes I take patches for that. I accepted the CMake build 
scripts on the condition that I wouln't personally maintain them though.

Subject: [ragel-users] Ragel syntax
Message-ID: <CAJHgk8vw_itFi2HGGNBS5OzWi6E61m0kpHU7J=ehVk4FWOBoNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am confused with the basic syntax of Ragel. Let's see this machine from
the ragel guide:

%%{ machine foo;
> main :=
> ( ’foo’ | ’bar’ )
> 0 @{ res = 1; };
> }%%
>

As far as I can understand this machine looks for the 'foo' or 'bar'
strings and sets the variable from the host language 'res' to 1 if a match
is found.

What I don't understand is what the 0 and the @{} stands for. What the
exact meaning of these signs and how they are used to run actions in case
of a match?

Thanks
Denes Lados
