Yes, that's right. I do like the idea of reducing the number of
operators and if I were to redesign ragel from the ground up this kind
of operator would be something to consider.

It would depend on the whole redesign, but I think a starting operator
(the current semantics) could still be desirable. Consider:

m1 = ':';
m2 = [a-z]*;

action act1 { printf( &quot;first char of m2 is %c\n&quot;, *p ); }

m = m1 &quot;&quot;%act1 m2 '\n';

Just to be clear, this is equivalent to the old semantics of &gt;. With
this you get the message on the newline in the case that m2 matches
nothing, which is wrong. You have to refactor things in order to &quot;fight&quot;
the behaviour of the operator. I don't like that. I'd rather you have to
refactor things to add the above effect when you want it. This is one of
the reasons for me simplifying &gt; and making it go ONLY on the first
characters of the machine, not also on pending out actions when the
start state is final.

&gt;<i> However, I understand the syntactic simplicity of &quot;&lt;expr&gt; &lt;op&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;action&gt;&quot; and, as much as I think it would be cool, it is not that
</I>&gt;<i> important from a practical point of view. Maybe, as a suggestion, you
</I>&gt;<i> could mention the ( &quot;&quot; %action ) trick in the documentation?
</I>
I think a ragel &quot;tricks/hacks&quot; section would be good. I can think of
other stuff to put in there :)
