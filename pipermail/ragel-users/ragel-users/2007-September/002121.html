<PRE>Hi,

I'm trying to parse the output of &quot;git diff&quot; and in particular lines  
which look like this:

   diff --git a/my file b/my file

Where &quot;a/my file&quot; is the &quot;from file&quot; and &quot;b/my file&quot; is the &quot;to  
file&quot;. This is slightly tricky because as you can see there are no  
delimiters between the two paths other than a space, but spaces are  
also allowed inside the paths (and Git only uses quotation marks here  
when the filenames contain embedded tabs, newlines, double-quotes or  
backslash charcters).

This means that the only sign that the &quot;from file&quot; has ended and the  
&quot;to file&quot; has begun is when you hit &quot; b/&quot;, but by the time you see  
that you're already inside the &quot;to file&quot; part. So I made rules to  
capture the &quot;from file&quot; and the &quot;to file&quot;, but my initial attempt at  
a &quot;from file&quot; rule was broken:

   from_file = &quot;a/&quot; (any+ -- &quot; b/&quot;) ;

The resulting state machine (quite correctly) takes input like:

   a/hello b/world

And identifies the &quot;from file&quot; as:

   a/hello b

Which is not what we want. One tactic is mash the &quot;from_file&quot; and  
&quot;to_file&quot; rules into a single rule:

   from_to_files = &quot;a/&quot; (any - linefeed)+ &quot; b/&quot; (any - linefeed)+ ;

But that produces a fairly ugly DFA (especially when you add in rules  
for parsing quotes filenames with embedded escape sequences). So I  
tried to implement a primitive form of manual lookahead as follows:

   from_file = &quot;a/&quot; (any - linefeed)+ %store &quot; b/&quot; @jumpback;

Where &quot;store&quot; is an action which records the recognized file and  
&quot;jumpback&quot; is just:

   action jumpback { p -= 3; }

The idea being that I have to &quot;lookahead&quot; and see the &quot; b/&quot; to know  
that the &quot;from file&quot; has been scanned, but then bump the current  
character pointer back by three so that the machine can resume  
scanning and looking for the &quot;to file&quot;.

The generated DFA for the rule looks correct to me and isn't too ugly  
(7 states, about 14 transitions). Is my approach ok, or is there a  
better way?

Apart from that the format I am trying to parse is totally regular,  
unambiguous, and can be parsed without backtracking, which is nice  
for a change!

Cheers,
Wincent
