I have not uncovered the limitations with hand-coding statecharts  
described by Zed. My guess is that we learned different strategies for  
implementing them. Here's who I learned from:

	Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts
	by Ian Horrocks, Addison-Wesley, 1999

	<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Constructing-User-Interface-Statecharts-Horrocks/dp/0201342782">http://www.amazon.com/Constructing-User-Interface-Statecharts-Horrocks/dp/0201342782</A>

The book is out of print, and a guy at work recently bought a used  
copy for $100 (it originally sold for $40, I think). The book is  
oriented towards writing the control layer in MVC software, but you  
can use statecharts anywhere. I use them in all three layers, client,  
server, and with databases. Basically, whenever the control logic  
degenerates to testing boolean flags* and changing behavior as a  
result, I immediately switch to statecharts because I know the  
resulting code will:

1. accurately reflect the control code as designed by me
2. be easy to debug and _verify_ using &quot;white box&quot; techniques
3. be easily enhanced over the lifetime of the system**

* The first boolean flag in code is usually a harbinger of more  
boolean flags to come. By switching to statecharts early, I can handle  
enhanced logic later in-stride and without impacting my schedule/budget.

** Ragel is particularly ill-suited to implementing statecharts that  
are modified over time, precisely _because_ it minimizes states. You  
don't want states combined or minimized because it makes it very  
difficult to extend and modify objects whose state is archived (e.g.  
in a database, on disk, whatever). Zed might not have run into this  
problem yet because he writes clients and servers in-sync, and they  
start with &quot;fresh state&quot; at each startup. Long-running systems can't  
rely on that behavior because they have persistent state.

There is a wide sense among programmers that state machines, including  
statecharts, make code hard to understand. I have no idea why this is  
the case, since my experience is the complete opposite.

As evidence, the first thing I do when working with a new library/API  
is to document what the API does with statecharts, where the &quot;events&quot;  
are function calls into the APIs (including pseudo-function calls if  
the API exposes data-as-symbols). I then translate that statecharts to  
code (in mock object fashion) and do &quot;forwarding&quot; calls to the real  
API during development. This has had two major advantages:

1. I can quickly and easily understand how the underlying API &quot;works&quot;  
from an external perspective, and _test those assumptions_ quickly and  
easily.
2. By running my own code against the mock object(s) (I call the mock  
objects constructed in this fashion &quot;state guards&quot;), I can be sure  
that I'm using the API consistently and within specifications at all  
times. An unhandled &quot;event&quot; (aka function call) in my state guard is  
evidence that I did something out-of-order, such as calling library  
code before calling the libraries &quot;init&quot; function.

I can't think of a higher complement to the understandability of  
statecharts than that. I find most code horrendously hard to read,  
regardless of how it was implemented. Statecharts remove all of that  
for me, quickly and easily, and forever. With stateguards and the  
graphical statechart diagrams, I can answer any question about the  
behavior of the API years down the road in seconds. _No other approach  
I've discovered can make that claim._

Zed makes good points based on his experience, and rather than try and  
refute each of them based on mine, I'll just quote from the book  
mentioned above. If the claims look good to you, I recommend tracking  
down the book and giving it a whirl. I can personally vouch for all of  
the benefits (as well as the limitations) given for statecharts.

Best, Erich

 From __Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts__ by Ian  
Horrocks, Addison-Wesley, 1999:

Advantages of the statechart approach
=====================================

General
-------

- a low number of bugs
- a language independent notation
- complicated user interfaces can be developed with ease
- the speed of user interface development is not reduced
- the performance of the software is not affected
- statecharts are easier to understand than code alone

Design
------

- the designs are precise and consistent
- the designs are modular
- the designs are compact
- the designs are kept up-to-date
- the designs can be reused


Coding
------

- simple and consistent code
- no requirements work during the coding phase
- the code is easy to debug
- the code facilitates walk-throughs

Testing
-------

- unit testing is thorough
- regression testing is efficient and effective
- the unit test cases are compact

Maintenance
-----------

- faults can be traced easily
- changes are local in effect
- very big changes to a user interface are relatively easy to achieve
- it is easy to maintain unfamiliar software
- estimates are more accurate

Some possible limitations of the statechart approach
====================================================

- translating a statechart to code is boring
- the code may not adhere to the design (if you modify the code  
without updating the design)
- the code can be indecipherable to people not familiar with the  
statechart notation
- the method will take a reasonable amount of time to learn
- developers, particularly weak developers, may resist the technique  
because of its rigour

&gt;<i> Now, what I've done in the past to remove 1-3 is to use statecharts
</I>&gt;<i> implemented as C macros and function call semantics.  You should also
</I>&gt;<i> go grab:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.quantum-leaps.com/">http://www.quantum-leaps.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ignore the hyperbole about &quot;quantum programming&quot; and just buy the
</I>&gt;<i> book. Miro Samek knows tons and tons and tons about doing statecharts
</I>&gt;<i> in hand-coded C++ and is also able to explain many concepts about
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical FSM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But still, it's a pain in the ass compared to using Ragel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bottom-line: hand-code statecharts. The hard part is creating the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statecharts themselves (I use OmniGraffle), not coding them up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's only because the distance from drawing to implementation is so
</I>&gt;<i> wide.  When you use Ragel the same syntax produces the diagram and the
</I>&gt;<i> code, so the distance is much shorter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, I wouldn't create a protocol handler without them. They  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extraordinarily efficient, **easy** to debug, and quick to modify. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create and modify statechart-based code daily at my day job, and use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statecharts on my own projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree with this.  Servers that don't have them are so much
</I>&gt;<i> harder to use.  I'm working on a new HTTP server/proxy and I'm totally
</I>&gt;<i> taking the methods I worked up for Utu in this one.  It's so much
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Zed Shaw has done some work with Ragel and statecharts if you still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to go down that path:

</I>&gt;<i> I'll be doing a new one of that for my new web server project.  Stay
</I>&gt;<i> tuned, I'll drop an announce here.
