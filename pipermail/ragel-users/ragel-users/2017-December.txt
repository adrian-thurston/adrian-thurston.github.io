Subject: [ragel] libragel missing in 7.0.0.10?
Message-ID: <1513000850.8459.2.camel@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am attempting to update the ragel package available in the Fedora
distribution and noticed that in ragel 7.0.0.10 the libragel.h and
associated build information is no longer present.

Did this functionality move to somewhere else in the code?

Thanks!

JT

Hi Jason,

libragel was a temporary measure that allowed the code to be used as a 
library with nearly the same interface as the binary. It was a quick 
hack of a solution for my problem at the time. Since then libfsm has 
entered and I use that instead now. Libragel is gone for good :)

Sorry, no change. The problems are in the form of memory leaks in ragel
mucking up your clean build reports? Maybe you could turn them off for
ragel? Honestly it's never really been a strong concern for me since
ragel is a one-shot kind of program. Some improvements were made when I
added libfsm, but that was mostly in the core FSM code. 

My current concerns with ragel are to get out-of-tree support for
alternate host languages. Will have some time for that in December.
Removing leaks is something I would work on when 7.0 gets to stable
status.
