Hi Everyone

Just to let you know that I'm moving the projects over to github. The 
main reason for this is that I'm starting to look for full-time work and 
no longer attempting to build a business around ragel and colm. This 
lets me open-up development a little more, since some of the work I had 
been doing included making modifications to ragel and colm that I could 
not necessarily do out in the open. Since I'm stopping this pursuit I 
decided to simplify things and move to github. Probably discussion will 
move over there as well. Some of you may recall these projects have been 
on github before and it tends to draw in activity. Also I've noticed a 
large number of users wanting to use systems like stack exchange. Right 
now I'm not sure of the future of the mailing lists. We will see I 
guess.

Thanks!

Adrian

Hi Adrian, I'd much prefer if email remained an option in case I
have questions.

I don't do JavaScript or web-based UIs outside of what w3m/lynx
can handle and don't know C++, so no opinions on the dev side.

As such, I've mostly given up being a software developer but I
still maintain some low-profile, legacy Free Software projects
which rely on Ragel since 2008 or so.

Thanks for Ragel!
