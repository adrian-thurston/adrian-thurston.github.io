If you want to support overlapping capture then the user needs to be
able to individually tag each capture start and capture stop with a
unique identifier. This identifier could be a variable and in C could
be a struct with members tokstart and tokend (or 'ts' and 'te'). This
way you'd always know when a capture is starting and ending.

Actually, I wasn't thinking of a scanner although that could be an
option if you think it's useful. I was thinking about just capturing
straight FSM input, in addition to longest-match capture.
