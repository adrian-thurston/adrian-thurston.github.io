<PRE>Hi Adrian,

&gt;<i> It might be possible to use Ragel as is. There is an experimental (and 
</I>&gt;<i> undocumented) semantic condition feature which obeys the rules of NFA to 
</I>&gt;<i> DFA conversion. A semantic condition is a block of code which is 
</I>&gt;<i> associated with a transition. It must evaluate to true for the 
</I>&gt;<i> transition to be taken. Conditions were introduced for the purpose of 
</I>&gt;<i> parsing variable length fields. You could use them to do a roll of the 
</I>&gt;<i> dice. Look in test/cond?.rl for examples of conditions.
</I>
That sounds great, thanks! I'll take a look at it this weekend.

&gt;<i> If conditions don't cut it, then modifying Ragel might be an option. 
</I>&gt;<i> Though I don't know enough about HMMs to say for sure if it could be 
</I>&gt;<i> done. How are HMMs specified?
</I>
It's usually specified by a matrix of probabilities, but that can be 
played around with. I'm actually writing a few pages on HMM usage in 
general and will be done in a few days. Would you be interested in 
reading a rough draft?

&gt;<i> I can tell you that Ragel was designed for producing deterministic 
</I>&gt;<i> parsers. Internally it has no epsilon transitions. Machines are made 
</I>&gt;<i> deterministic on the fly. So it doesn't have many of the features that 
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive state machine libraries like Grail+ have.
</I>
I'm not sure what the breadth of those features is like, but I took a 
look at the examples available at 
<A HREF="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Research/grail/.man/index.html">http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Research/grail/.man/index.html</A> and from the looks 
of it, I don't really need those. All I'm after is a very efficient 
finite state machine with probabilities in its transitions and possibly 
emissions.

Thanks,
Edward
