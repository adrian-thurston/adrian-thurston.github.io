Sure, you could do that but, at the same time, you could also do it
sequentially with pretty much the same end result given that string
concatenation is a pretty simple thing to do. Personally, I don't feel
the need for capture within capture although it could prove useful in
certain contexts.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm,  'alltokstarts' could be updated at the beginning of each capture
with something like min(alltokstarts, ts(n)), no? This would scale
well.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;From the point of view of the FSM, the inline scanner would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual state. Transitions to this virtual state would happen if and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only if at least one of the inline scanner patterns matches. If there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no possible match then the FSM would error.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>From what you're saying it seems like it's not really a scanner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, it's not like a regular scanner that keeps repeatedly trying to
match any of the expressions. I guess I should rename my proposed
'inline scanner' to 'longest-match capture'.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>but more like a union because if it finishes when it matches a
</I>pattern then it won't
&gt;<i>ever match more than one. Is that right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, union with a twist. For example, with:

|&gt;<i> patternA =&gt; actionA; patternB =&gt; actionB; &lt;|
</I>
Once patternA or patternB matches (the longest or the first wins as
with a regular scanner), the capture machine is done.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If that's the case then it seems like the criteria for it starting is
</I>the same as for it finishing.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, not sure I'm following you here. In any case, after I emailed the
list yesterday, I thought a little bit more about the use of state
embeddings as a way to emulate this functionality and end up
concluding that it was probably rubbish. But I thought that the state
chart paradigm could be used to illustrate the basic idea. For
example, with an expression like:

pattern= patA |&gt; patB1 =&gt; actionB1; patB2 =&gt; actionB2; &lt;| patC;

one could have a state chart like so:

pattern = (

    start: ( patA -&gt; matched_patA ),

    matched_patA: ( |&gt; patB1 =&gt; actionB1; patB2 =&gt; actionB2; &lt;| -&gt;
matched_patB ),

    matched_patB: ( patC -&gt; final )

);

Another thing to consider is whether my initially proposal of strictly
relying on longest-match for capture makes sense. Maybe the programmer
should have a choice?

So, do you think this is something you'd be willing to implement? :-)

Thanks!

Carlos
