Hi.

I've noticed a slice discrepancy between code and documentation.
It's about "cntrl" built-in machine. Documentation says it is equivalent
to 0..31, but when cntrl is used, in generated code it also includes 127.

It does include 127. I just updated the docs. Wow, that was in there a 
long time! Thanks for pointing it out.

Hi,
I need to parse 4 bytes of data and some bits of data has valid information.
How can I go with Ragel?
I am going to use Ragel with  C++.

Best regards
Sothy

Hi Sothy, you need to specify the grammar at the byte level. You can
union bit patterns together, however.

Thanks Adrain,

I am new to Ragel. I have one question.
One BYTE information: 010 1 1 000
I need to take firrst three bits into one int, other two bits are two
boolean values and other three are together for one int.

How to write grammar for parsing this data?

Thanks for your help.

Best regards
Sothy

Looks like you accept all bytes so you don't really need ragel for that. Just need to mask and shift the bits.
