Hi,

Sorry I missed this message.

In a simple state machine, it might seem natural to give states the 
names that come from source file, but unfortunately it doesn't 
generalize. States are often the combination of several states defined 
in the source file. Also, states specified in the source can end up 
contributing to more than one state in the compiled machine.

Subject: [ragel-users] Gearman Protocol
Message-ID: <AANLkTin_EZaYL22PPbn=-tqz5H-rXi+FM86Qb=C4cawA@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy, I'm trying my hand at a Ragel machine to parse the Gearman
protocol found here: http://gearman.org/index.php?id=protocol

Here's what I have so far: http://gist.github.com/520065

I'm not sure why, but it's telling me:

$ ragel -R -s gearman.rl
lexer.rl:117:3: sorry, no more characters are available in the alphabet space
lexer.rl:117:3:   for conditions, please use a smaller alphtype or reduce
lexer.rl:117:3:   the span of characters on which conditions are embedded

It seems to be the line "  data        = (any when test_size)*;"

But I'm just going off of the Ragel guide, section 6.5. Is that "when"
syntax not supported? How can I guarantee the length and data's length
are the same?

Thanks!
Colin

What you're seeing is a limitation of conditions and large alphabets. To 
implement conditions Ragel eats up characters in the alphabet space. It 
does so quite aggressively (actually eats up bits). The int alphabet 
type doesn't have much space to begin with. The standard remedy is to 
use a smaller alphabet type.

What I need to do is to convert Ragel to internally use variable-size 
alphabet types so this limit is hit less, but that's further down the 
road for Ragel at this time.

Hello folks!

  I'm using ragel to parse my project configs and faced with strange ragel
behavior. Seems I've found a bug, but I'm not sure. So, use case was
following:

Input cpp file contained:

 . . .
   %%{
   write data;
   write init;
   write exec;
   }%%
. . .
   DBG_ERROR(("ConfigReader::readConfig: error opening config file '%s'!",
configFile.getBuffer() ));

DBG_ERROR is my debug macro.

After compiling this file using ragel I've found that block %%{ . . . }%%
wasn't processed by ragel and was leaved as is in destination cpp file.

When I changed '%s' to %s (without quotes) problem has gone! Seems '%s'
substring makes ragel crazy. =)

Someone faced with something like this?

*With kindest regards,*
*Alexander*

Hi Alexander,

I can't reproduce the problem using these instructions. Can you send me 
the exact input file that causes the problem? I will treat it as 
confidential.
