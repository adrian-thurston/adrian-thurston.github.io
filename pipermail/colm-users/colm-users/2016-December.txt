Subject: [colm] patch for colm to handle with '-I' and '-L' command line
	options
Message-ID: <1483180096.3788.2.camel@verpeteren.nl>

hello 

I found it quite cumbersome to 'make install' and 'make uninstall' to
assert that colm uses the correct headers.
Upon further analyzing it turned out that:
1) the '-I' command line option was not active
2) there were 2 almost identical functions that to build the gcc
commands.
After refractoring and testing, I added also the '-L' command line
argument to extend the library path.

With these 2 command line options working, it is possible to use colm
from an arbitrary directory.


I hope that the attached patch is usefull for somebody to ease
development.

Some time ago I investigated how I the build process of colm is working.
It is not compiling and linking. Colm is bootstrapped in a clever way.
The 'main.cc' is compiled 3 times with various '-D' flags.
At that time I create this graph to get an better overview.
Please not that this is just a high level overview. Not all files
(.c, .cc, .h, .o) are name explicitly. 

Hopefully is usable for others in the future.

Some time ago I investigated how I the all the headerfiles are related /

At that time I create this graph to get an better overview.
I used the output of 'gcc -MM' to handcraft a nice dot file.

Hi Peter,

I can't seem to get the patch to apply. I don't have the base commit. 
Maybe there is a missing intermediate commit?

Thanks,
