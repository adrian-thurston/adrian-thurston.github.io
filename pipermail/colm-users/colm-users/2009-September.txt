Hello,

So I'm back to working on Colm, after a much-needed break from the 
topic. I spent my time away from it designing a Distributed Social 
Networking Protocol. While that is far from done, it is time to get back 
to my roots and hack on computer language tools.

I started with two new iterators: repeat and rev_repeat. These are for 
walking right-recursive lists without recursing into the element of the 
list. An example can be found here:

http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/repeat.lm

The rev_repeat iterator is especially useful for picking items out of a 
right-recursive list.

Subject: [colm-users] new way of constructing trees
Message-ID: <4AA84042.8080205@complang.org>

Hi,

I'm experimenting with a new way in Colm to make trees. The existing 
construct expression is useful for building trees in a bottom up 
fashion. It is parsed at compile-time to give some static assurance of 
success.

The existing parse expression can be used to parse from a stream source, 
or reparse the text of a tree as a new type. The parsing happens at 
run-time and may fail.

A new third method, the accumulator, can be used to incrementally build 
a tree by parsing little bits at a time. This is useful for building an 
output tree over the course of a top-down, left-right traversal.

See here for a simple example:

http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/accum.lm
http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/accum.in

Like reparse in TXL, except you don't have to give it all the text at 
once. You can can give it bit-by-bit.

The syntax might not be right. I'm currently using the same syntax as 
for match and construct (literals in "). Both of these have a type 
associated with them and are parsed at compile-time. This does not have 
a type, instead it's just like text that gets parsed at run-time. That's 
one syntax, two meanings. Not the greatest.

I'm thinking maybe use backticks instead to specify text with embedded 
variables.

Output <<
	`void f( int i, [SomeType] j );`

Like reparse in TXL, except you don't have to give it all the text at 
once. You can can give it bit-by-bit.

The syntax might not be right. I'm currently using the same syntax as 
for match and construct (literals in "). Both of these have a type 
associated with them and are parsed at compile-time. This does not have 
a type, instead it's just like text that gets parsed at run-time. That's 
one syntax, two meanings. Not the greatest.

I'm thinking maybe use backticks instead to specify text with embedded 
variables.

Output <<
	`void f( int i, [SomeType] j );`

The DNS test case is functional again. For a while, the token position 
information was not functional. This test case depended on that the 
extraction of the the byte-offset of tokens.

In order to ensure regressions to not take place, a test suite has been 
started, with dns.lm being the first case.

To run it go: cd test && ./runtests

There will be more tests added in the future.

Subject: [colm-users] two new iterators
Message-ID: <4A9C7573.1090408@complang.org>

Hello,

So I'm back to working on Colm, after a much-needed break from the 
topic. I spent my time away from it designing a Distributed Social 
Networking Protocol. While that is far from done, it is time to get back 
to my roots and hack on computer language tools.

I started with two new iterators: repeat and rev_repeat. These are for 
walking right-recursive lists without recursing into the element of the 
list. An example can be found here:

http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/repeat.lm

The rev_repeat iterator is especially useful for picking items out of a 
right-recursive list.

Subject: [colm-users] parsing the text of a tree
Message-ID: <4A9DA6CA.5020708@complang.org>

It is now possible to parse the text of a tree. The effect is the same 
as calling print() on the tree and then parsing the result.

Attached is an example.

Sweet. That’s going to come in handy.

Subject: [colm-users] new way of constructing trees
Message-ID: <4AA84042.8080205@complang.org>

Hi,

I'm experimenting with a new way in Colm to make trees. The existing 
construct expression is useful for building trees in a bottom up 
fashion. It is parsed at compile-time to give some static assurance of 
success.

The existing parse expression can be used to parse from a stream source, 
or reparse the text of a tree as a new type. The parsing happens at 
run-time and may fail.

A new third method, the accumulator, can be used to incrementally build 
a tree by parsing little bits at a time. This is useful for building an 
output tree over the course of a top-down, left-right traversal.

See here for a simple example:

http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/accum.lm
http://svn.complang.org/colm/trunk/test/accum.in

Cool, I think - not sure that I understand!
