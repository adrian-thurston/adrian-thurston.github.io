The test repository will come back. Had to clear it out before making the repository live again because of proprietary cases. I need to split it first.
I'll look into the examples soon. Unlikely I'll change the backtick syntax as there is very little room for alternatives in the syntax at this point. Much effort has gone into exploring different possibilities.
Double and single lits are for parsed things and plain strings. Backticks are not parsed and just refer to an unnamed token by what the parser scans for. It's really a type.
If someone else wants to mirror on github they are free to but I would prefer to host the repository on a colm networks server.

Subject: [colm] Literals with backtick &quot;transformation language that is
  closer to general-purpose programming, languages&quot; ? 

Hello !
I'm reading thurston-phdthesis.pdf and came to the &quot;chapter 6 examples&quot; 
and found that the actual &quot;colm&quot; version do not accept the examples and 
there is no updated examples on it's repository.

I'm not sure that using backtick as literal start token is accordingly 
with &quot;transformation language that is closer to general-purpose 
programming,languages&quot;, why not have both the convention string 
delimited with &quot; or ' ?

Can the examples shown in the phd thesis be updated and available on 
it's repository ?

Also there was a commit that removed the tests and say that they moved 
to a test-colm repository but it doesn't seem to be available, can it be 
made available ?

Why not have &quot;colm&quot; and &quot;ragel&quot; mirrored on github ? It would make a lot 
easier for contributions.

Cheers !
