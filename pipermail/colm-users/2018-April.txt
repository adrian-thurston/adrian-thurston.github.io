Subject: [colm-users] test suite
Message-ID: <683164e4cd7737a2aad4a1f6950aeea4@mail.colm.net>

Hello,

Just a heads up, I'll be moving the test suites for ragel and colm out 
of the main source trees. The number of cases that I can't share 
publicly is growing and I need to start putting all the cases that I 
look after in one place and start using some common tools across the 
collection. So what I'll do is export a 'public slice' of the full 
colm.net test suite as a tarball with each release.

Subject: [colm-users] colm-0.13.0.5 fails to build on Gentoo Prefix on 32bit
	OS on a VM
Message-ID: <CABVqfw_wWP=N1FJmk12g9+ut4PB4aH5OMNKfQ16TJfGpXogjAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

(Sorry if this mail may be received twice in the list).

I've seen that you had some conversation about that already at:

http://www.colm.net/pipermail/colm-users/2017-June/000175.html

But it never got anywhere, I think. The last comment of Adrian Thurston
says that build dependencies are missing.

I tried reproducing the same thing and it did work for me (so I got the
same compilation error). I did miss the first time doing:

su - abuild


As explained in http://www.colm.net/pipermail/colm-users/2017-June/000175.
html by Jan Engelhardt.

Which gave me the same errors mentioned by Adrian.

So, to reproduce it I did (just for clarity):

cd tmp
wget http://inai.de/files/colm/COLM-img
wget http://inai.de/files/colm/COLM-initrd
wget http://inai.de/files/colm/COLM-kernel
wget http://inai.de/files/colm/COLM-start

chmod +x COLM-start
./COLM-start

su - abuild

cd ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/colm-0.13.0.5
make clean
./configure
make


And I got back to:

bootstrap1: tree.c:953: colm_tree_downref: Assertion `tree->refs > 0'
failed.


(I have a VM where I can reproduce it also, but I can't share it publicly).

Can I get onto the VM where it can be reproduced?

Hello,

I made a Docker image that you may use to (hopefully) quickly reproduce the
bug. The instructions on how to use it are here:

https://github.com/awesomebytes/colm_docker

Mainly:

docker pull awesomebytes/colm_environment:1

docker run --privileged -v $HOME:/shared -it awesomebytes/colm_environment:1

./COLM-start


su - abuild


cd ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/colm-0.13.0.5
make clean
./configure
make

Extra info is in the README of the github repo.

Thank you for taking a look into it again!

Hi, yes would like to have this fixed at some point. Sorry no ETA at the
moment.

Okay thanks. I haven't used docker before (although a huge fan of linux
namespaces). I'm assuming I need to do a lot of downloading to get this
going? I'm not currently on a good internet connection, and I'm stuck on
a very old laptop after leaving my good one on the top of my car and
getting on the highway. Is there anything about this docker image that
expires?

But can you briefly describe what does each type code_t, word_t, half_t and what are the requirements in size and made to them.
